And they suggest the comments didn't affect Trump in Iowa (he was at 16 percent before the comments and 18 percent after), but they did hurt him in New Hampshire (26 percent before, 14 percent after).\n\nDespite his poll position, Trump's favorable/unfavorable rating among Iowa Republicans is just 45 percent/44 percent, and it's 39 percent/53 percent among GOP voters in New Hampshire.\n\nHillary leads big in Iowa – but by a smaller margin in New Hampshire\n\nMeanwhile, in the Democratic presidential race, the polls show that Hillary Clinton is ahead, but that Bernie Sanders has gained ground on her since earlier this year.\n\nIn Iowa, Clinton leads Sanders by 29 points, 55 percent to 26 percent, with Martin O'Malley at 4 percent and Jim Webb at 2 percent. In a February NBC-Marist poll of the Hawkeye State, Sanders was just 7 percent in a field that also included Vice President Joe Biden, who isn't expected to run for president.\n\nIn New Hampshire, Clinton is ahead of Sanders (who represents neighboring Vermont in the U.S. Senate) by 13 points, 47 percent to 34 percent. They're followed by O'Malley at 5 percent and Lincoln Chafee at 2 percent.\n\nBack in February, Sanders was at 13 percent.\n\nBoth Clinton and Sanders are popular among Democrats in these two states. Clinton's fav/unfav is 74 percent/20 percent in Iowa (+54), and it's 71 percent/23 percent in New Hampshire (+48).\n\nSanders' is 54 percent/15 percent in the Hawkeye State (+39), and 65 percent/14 percent in the Granite State (+51).\n\nBut among all registered voters in these two presidential battleground states, the NBC-Marist polls finds that almost all of the major presidential candidates are unpopular – and that's especially true for Clinton.\n\nThe favorable/unfavorable scores in Iowa among all registered voters:\n\nSanders +3 (30 percent/27 percent)\n\nRubio -1 (31 percent/32 percent)\n\nWalker -1 (30 percent/31 percent)\n\nBush -12 (34 percent/46 percent)\n\nTrump -28 (32 percent/60 percent)\n\nNotably, Clinton's fav/unfav score in Iowa among all registered voters mirrors what a recent Quinnipiac poll of the state found .\n\nThe favorable/unfavorable scores in New Hampshire:\n\nSanders +12 (41 percent/29 percent)\n\nBush -5 (40 percent/45 percent)\n\nWalker -6 (28 percent/34 percent)\n\nRubio -6 (28 percent/34 percent)\n\nClinton -20 (37 percent/57 percent)\n\nTrump -40 (27 percent/67 percent)\n\nThe NBC-Marist polls also find that President Barack Obama is unpopular in both states. His approval rating stands at 43 percent in Iowa and 41 percent in New Hampshire.\n\nAnd his fav/unfav numbers are upside down in both states – 46 percent/51 percent in Iowa (-5) and 43 percent/53 percent in New Hampshire (-10).\n\nFinally, the polls show that majorities of voters in the two states (61 percent in Iowa, 55 percent in New Hampshire) agree with the statement – originally made by former First Lady Barbara Bush – that the country has had enough Bushes and Clintons in the White House, and it's time to give someone else a chance.\n\nThe NBC-Marist poll of Iowa was conducted July 14-21 of 919 registered voters (+/- 3.2 percentage points), 342 potential GOP caucus-goers (+/- 5.3 percentage points) and 320 potential Democratic caucus-goers (+/- 5.5 percentage points).\n\nThe NBC-Marist poll of New Hampshire was conducted July 14-21 of 910 registered voters (+/- 3.2 percentage points), 401 potential GOP primary voters (+/- 4.9 percentage points) and 329 potential Democratic primary voters (+/- 5.4 percentage points).\n\nView the full Iowa poll here.\n\nView the full New Hampshire poll here.",

I wasn’t attempting to mimic any culture, nor resemble one. A “Jewish stereotype” never crossed my mind.\n\nMy intention was to dress up and surprise the people at the show with a random costume and nothing more. Thus, it was surprising and disappointing that the images of a disguise were sensationalized leading to the immediate assertion that my costume was anti-Semetic [sic]. I acknowledge how the costume could, within a context of stereotyping, be ascribed to a Jewish caricature. I am here to say that it was absolutely not my intention, and unfortunately at the time I did not foresee the costume to be viewed in such regard.\n\nHe also — wisely — issued a blanket apology, writing: “I truly apologize to anybody that I may have offended.”",

        "instruction": "It follows cuts made by Avios (previously Airmiles) and Sainsbury’s Bank earlier in the year, with more banks expected to follow suit.\n\nIs cashback dead? Our table shows which providers still expect to offer benefits when the cap is introduced in October.\n\nCurrently, shops pay credit card companies 0.7pc, on average, of the purchase price. Debit card purchases incur an average 9p fee.\n\nFirms earn just £14, on average, per year, from each credit card customer, according to financial consultants Simon Kucher and Partners. The changes will cut this by up to 70pc, the firm said.\n\n“Generous introductory rates and cashback offers will be under heavy scrutiny and will probably be cut back in the future,” said Jens Baumgarten, who advises British banks for the firm.\n\nCard providers are now looking for ways to tap into other sources of revenue, for example increasing APR charges for borrowers, said Mr Baumgarten. “As much as they would like to offset the interchange cuts, the solution for many banks will be to cut card offers,” he said.\n\nBut not all credit card firms will scrap their perks.\n\nAqua, a credit card firm that pays 0.5pc on purchases, told Telegraph Money it has no plans to ditch its cashback offering.\n\nThis may offer hope to former Capital One customers, as both cards accept borrowers with poor or limited credit history. This group might be turned down by other popular cashback providers such as Santander and American Express, for example.\n\nAmex also says it has no plan to scrap its 5pc cashback cards as a result of the cap to in-shop fees. This is because the firm negotiates its price directly with shops and isn’t covered by the interchange fees.\n\n“We don’t therefore anticipate making any changes to these products in direct response to this regulation,” an Amex spokesman said. “We do regularly review our products to ensure they remain competitive.”\n\nCard companies could lose profits of up to 70pc as a result of new EU rules\n\nWith its fee-free Platinum Everyday card, Amex pays 5pc on £2,000 of spending in the first three months, generating a maximum of £100 cashback.\n\nAfter the three months, tiered cashback rates of between 0.5pc and 1.25pc will apply. So spend £0 to £3,500 a year and you will receive 0.5pc cashback on that amount. Between £3,500 and £7,500, it is 1pc cashback. Above that, it rises to 1.25pc.\n\nThe big caveat with this is that if you don’t get your spending above £3,000 a year, then you receive no cashback.\n\nSantander, which pays cashback on its “123” credit card, including transport (3pc) and supermarket shopping (1pc) said it would need to “reflect” on the impact of the interchange fees.\n\nA spokesman said: “We regularly review all our products to ensure that they offer value to our customers as well as our shareholders. Clearly the change in the way that interchange is now calculated impacts the economics of any card business.”\n\nThis week the Spanish-owned bank extended its cashback deal to include the London cycle scheme. The card currently pays up to £9 a month on transport spending, such as petrol and rail tickets.\n\nFor a credit card company such as Capital One, commission from shops is much more critical to their business than for a bank, for example.\n\nThis is because banks may offer generous credit card deals in the hope that their customers will sign up for other more profitable products, such as current accounts.\n\n“Stand-alone providers don’t offer lots of other deals which they can cross-sell to their customers – so the cards need to pay for themselves,” said James Daley, of ratings website Fairer Finance. “As always, how banks make their money from cards is complex.”\n\nCustomers who pay off their balances each month in full will be hit the hardest, said Mr Daley. They were the ones who gained most from the perks funded by higher interchange fees.\n\n“Increasing the APR for these customers will be irrelevant, because they pay off every month,” Mr Daley added.\n\nThe EU move may also limit the crop of 0pc credit card deals which enable a money-making trick known as “stoozing”.\n\nStoozing works by borrowing “free” money via an interest-free credit card and saving it in a high-interest savings account.\n\nFor example, a borrower could earn £61.20 before tax if they transferred £2,000 from the MBNA Platinum Credit Card into a Nationwide current account that pays 5pc.\n\nThe credit card, offered only through Moneysupermarket, a price comparison website, offers 0pc for 24 months, with a 1.94pc fee on transfers.\n\nThe borrower would need to remember to pay the “minimum payment” amount in order to keep the 0pc deal.\n\nThese offers could be thinner on the ground in the future, warns Andrew Hagger, a banking commentator. He said: “The new cap could signal ‘revert to’ rate increases, when the zero-interest promotional period ends.”\n\n>> For more on the best card deals go to telegraph.co.uk/creditcards\n\n>> The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter",

        "instruction": "Updated DEC 02, 2014 6:14p ET\n\nTUCSON, Ariz. -- Arizona wide receiver coach Tony Dews has no problem using his best and most-seasoned receiver, Austin Hill, as an example. After all, life is tough and examples of fortitude make you tougher.\n\nHill knows all about that as he winds down his career in what is a glorious time to be an Arizona Wildcat. He'll have at least two more games to play, starting with Friday's Pac-12 Championship against Oregon (FOX, 7 p.m. MT) in Santa Clara, Calif.\n\n\"In a film session I got into him pretty good,\" Dews said of a recent meeting. \"But at the end of it, I reminded all the kids in the room that I'll jump his butt because he's a fifth-year senior and I expect more out of him. He can mess up and still play all the time because he's proven.\n\n\"He's done it. He's made big plays for this program.\"\n\nBig, indeed. But team guys usually do, understanding the big picture. They understand winning isn't just about them. And as Dews puts it, Hill is the ultimate team player.\n\n\"Everyone wants to catch the ball, but it's a sweet feeling to play for a championship,\" Dews said.\n\nAnd here Arizona is, at 10-2, playing for the Pac-12 title with still an outside chance of playing for a national championship. Three months ago, none of that seemed possible. The same can be said for three weeks ago, with the Wildcats on the ropes against Washington and time ticking away.\n\nBut the Wildcats and Hill have both found their way. The Wildcats have done it by living up to their mantra of \"60 minutes of Arizona football\" every week, and Hill has accomplished it by reinventing himself after what was a serious knee injury more than 18 months ago. Hill got up and worked his tail off in preparing for his senior year in what has turned out to be a Cinderella season.\n\nAs Dews said, \"everything happens for a reason,\" and Hill's injury -- as bad as it was -- has led to some good things for both the program and Hill. To name one, there was the \"Hill Mary\" grab in Arizona's very first Pac-12 game of the season, giving the Wildcats an improbable victory over California and setting the stage for what's happened since.\n\n\"The day he got hurt . . . as the saying goes, that was so 10 minutes ago. You got hurt and you never want to get hurt, but that's in the past,\" Dews said. \"What are you going to do about it? Cry and mope about it? Or (think) what's next and let's get moving on it.\"\n\nHill moved on. He had no choice.\n\n\"We didn't give him a chance to feel sorry for himself,\" Dews said. \"It was one of those things where everything in life happens for a reason. That happened so he could catch that Hail Mary. It happened because he was here to help (receivers) Cayleb (Jones) and Da'Vonte (Neal). He could help bring them along in this group.\n\n\"Maybe that was the reason. I don't know. Anytime something like that happens it always appears to be a big negative, but maybe it is a positive. It's how you take it. Maybe he appreciates now with all the success in what the group is having and knowing he was part of the foundation.\"\n\nIn so many ways, it hasn't been the season Hill might have imagined. He's second on the team with 42 receptions for 586 yards and four touchdowns, but those numbers are a far cry from the 81 catches, 1,364 yards (second in the Pac-12) and 11 TDs of his sophomore season. And as the season has marched on, he's often found himself lining up as something of a hybrid tight end/wide receiver -- because that's where Arizona needs him.\n\nMark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAustin Hill holds the hand of his daughter, Baylee Hill, while being introduced on Senior Day prior to Arizona's victory over Arizona State in the Territorial Cup game.\n\n\"I am just trying to be as physical as I can and get the blocks in as best I can,\" Hill said. \"I have been spending some time with my linemen buddies, practicing my blocking. Physically, I'm not a tight end, but it's still fun throwing your weight around in there, and I definitely thought I played well blocking last game ... whatever I can do to help the team.\"\n\nArizona coach Rich Rodriguez said Hill took a step back and looked at the game through a different set of eyes when he sat out last season. \"It made him hungry to come back,\" Rodriguez said. \"I'm proud of what he's done.\"\n\nHill said he considers himself a better player now than before the injury.\n\n\"I am definitely a more complete player now,\" he said. \"Instead of knowing (just the) secondary, I know fronts now, the various techniques and so on. It is definitely fun, and helps to really understand defenses now. And I really think I am smarter because of that, as opposed to two years ago.\"\n\nHis progression and transformation has mirrored the program's. Two years ago, none of this seemed likely, though Hill dismisses the notion it was unimaginable.\n\n\"I definitely thought we would be able to make it to the Pac 12 Championships,\" Hill said. \"I think you always need to have that confidence as a team, especially to have success in the season. I know that we've always had that confidence. We knew that we were going to try and improve ourselves and have a great season, and I think we're doing just that. We still have a lot to work on, but we're going to keep pushing.\"\n\nFollow Steve Rivera on Twitter",

        "instruction": "Despite other drawbacks, that include paying as much as $21 per kilo for snow peas (something they could get for a few dollars per kilo at home) and the occasional cyclone, the couple said they are happy with their decision to buy the three-acre island. They rent a three-bedroom luxury property to customers (among their big name clients: hotel heiress Paris Hilton) who pay upwards of $2,459 per night to get the private island experience sans ownership.\n\n“The transition was really complicated, but we wanted to run a business that would provide us a relaxed income and get my husband out of the corporate life,” Tracey Johnston said.\n\nOwning a private island isn’t just for billionaires like Richard Branson, who actually only paid $180,000 for Necker Island. Price tags for islands range from $80,000 to $600 million. Shouldering the upfront cost is only the first of many hurdles.\n\nWhy buy an island in the first place? For some people, it’s a level of prestige. For others, it’s about new business opportunities — developing and running boutique resorts or exclusive guest houses, for instance. Still others acquire the land as investment property, to build a second home, or for corporate development.\n\nFewer than a thousand properties can be found on the market worldwide each year, according to the Private Islands Buyer’s Guide. For prospective buyers, the majority of islands for sale can be found through websites like Private Islands Online and Vladi, though a few properties can even be found on Craigslist or real estate agents.\n\nAsia is one of the most expensive regions to buy in, since there is fierce competition for few properties in that region. Some of the most reasonably priced islands can be found in Central American countries like Belize.\n\nThere are several common ways islands are sold, or, in some cases, leased.\n\nAmong them, freehold leases grant 100% ownership of the land and any buildings on it. Such leases are common in Europe, the Americas, and the Caribbean. That’s how Tynan (who goes by a single name), American cofounder of blogging platform SETT, partially-purchased a five-acre island one hour by boat from Halifax, Canada. After finding the land on Craigslist, he and nine friends split the $100,000 cost. The group set up a corporation in the United States and combined their assets in order to pay in cash. As one of the mandates of the acquisition, a Canadian lawyer was required to register the deed.\n\nThe other main option, a leasehold, is less ownership and more traditional lease. With this method, buyers sign a long-term lease typically between 30 to 99 years, which grants them temporary possession through the government entity, corporation, or individual that legally owns the land.\n\nChris Krolow, chief executive officer of Private Islands Online, said buying or selling island property is a precarious business. Short selling seasons, lack of precedents for price setting and other complications such as obtaining building permits can hinder deals. It can take two to three years to sell a property on the international market and six months to a year on the local market, he said.\n\n“You can’t just put up a for-sale sign on an island and have an open house,” Krolow said. “There’s a lot more play in this business than a lot of people think.”\n\nIn Fiji, the Johnstons have a 99-year lease under a local family clan called the Mataqali. Upon arrival to the island, the Johnstons had to present a whale’s tooth with a portion of ropes to the local chief as a token of respect. This was followed by a similar presentation to the regional chief Ratu Seva.\n\nOnce accepted into the community, they took out loans to complete $1 million in renovations, which included installing a sewage treatment plant.\n\nAt first, Tracey had difficulty even ordering supplies and setting up accounts simply because she was a woman. Men in Fiji typically execute business transactions.\n\n“They didn’t want to deal with me, they wanted the boss,” Tracey Johnston said. “Sometimes I had to put my 21 year-old son on the phone and say, ‘please tell these people I am the boss’. But they got used to it.”\n\nFortunately for the Johnstons, Wadigi’s proximity to the mainland provides easy transport, fast shipping, and readily available evacuation if need be during storms. Regular barges, ferries, and water taxis pass by, a valuable convenience since many other island owners must charter private barges and seaplanes to their properties.\n\nAccessibility is a major factor for many prospective island buyers, Tynan said. Often, the most affordable islands are in remote locations that require long travel hours and multiple forms of transportation to reach.\n\nOther challenges of island ownership include tropical storms, stringent environmental regulations, beaches that must remain open for public use, and vermin infestation like sand flies and poisonous water snakes.\n\nDespite the occasional cyclone, the Johnstons said relocation to an island is the life-changing experience they had hoped for.\n\nWhen regional chief Ratu Seva inherited prominence, the Johnstons were invited to his initiation ceremony. They escorted the new leader and his warriors by motorboat to take a customary swim at natural pools around the main reef. As each person of the chiefdom hierarchy took a turn diving in, they pointed to Tracey Johnston and invited her to swim—a ritual typically only for men.\n\n“It communicated that I was accepted, I was part of their family,” she said.\n\nFollow BBC Capital on Twitter @BBC_Capital or follow us and join the conversation about this or any other Capital story on Facebook: BBC Capital on Facebook.",

        "instruction": "The last major efforts to change gun laws came in the wake of the 2012 rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, when 20 young schoolchildren and six adults were slain in their classrooms. Then, the president issued a series of executive actions and recommended congressional action which was never passed.\n\nThis week, amid a spate of mass shootings, the debate over how to reduce gun violence has been renewed. Wednesday's shooting in San Bernardino at Inland Regional Center came less than a week after a gunman opened fire at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs.\n\nUnlike the Colorado shooting, the San Bernardino massacre increasingly appears to be an act of terrorism. But the fact that one of the perpetrators was an American citizen and the guns purchased legally puts this crime into a new gray area that will create more challenges for lawmakers trying to prevent more gun deaths.\n\nHere are five ideas the U.S. could look consider to reduce gun violence -- from Democrats and Republicans.\n\nLoopholes now exist in the background check system that make it possible for people with criminal records or mental health issues to procure guns. For instance, a gun purchased over the Internet or from a private individual at a gun show is not subject to a background check because neither instance involves licensed gun sellers.\n\nAfter Newtown, the gun-related legislation that seemed most likely to make it through Congress was a 2013 bill cosponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, and Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, to strengthen background checks by closing those very loopholes. But it died on the Senate floor when it failed to attract enough support. The Senate voted on that measure again Thursday along with a series of Democratic proposals to reduce gun violence, and it failed on a 48-50 vote.\n\nJim Kessler, the senior vice president for policy at centrist think tank Third Way, told CBS News that Mr. Obama should consider doing it himself -- using his executive authority to close those loopholes by defining gun shows and the Internet as places where people engage in the business of gun sales, so they would be required to do background checks.\n\n\"It's a controversial notion,\" he said, and one the Obama administration has considered and rejected before. \"But I think it's worth looking at again,\" he argued.\n\nThe White House has also weighed the idea of imposing background check requirements on gun dealers who sell a large number of firearms and requiring them to be licensed by the ATF.\n\nIn the wake of the Paris terror attacks, Democrats also introduced legislation that would stop people on the U.S. no-fly list from purchasing guns and ammunition.\n\n\"If you are too dangerous to board a plane, you're too dangerous to buy a gun,\" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said.\n\nThe bill failed to pass a procedural hurdle along with the other Democratic gun control proposals. Kessler said that most of the legislation to address these issues will get nowhere in Congress.\n\n\"The National Rifle Association has a stranglehold on Congress, and particularly Republicans in Congress, and so even the most common-sense law faces just a steep uphill climb,\" he said.\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly argued for measures that address mental health issues. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, is among them and is backing a bill proposed by Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pennsylvania.\n\nMurphy, a career psychologist, has been working on the legislation since the Newtown shooting. His bill aims to improve treatment for people with serious mental health issues like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and increase the availability of beds for psychiatric patients. These strategies would both reduce the chances that those with mental health issues become violent and get more people into mental health treatment - and into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, so they can't purchase guns.\n\n\"These are people we can identify and help early on for treatment...many of these cases never have to advance to level of violence,\" Murphy told CBS News.\n\nMurphy concedes his proposal can't address issues like keeping guns away from criminals or terrorists.\n\nAnd Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, told CBS News it's not enough. Addressing mental health issues, he said, accounts \"for a relatively small share of all acts of serious violence. If we magically came up with a total cure for all mental illness, we would prevent no more than 5 percent of violent crime.\"\n\nA Democratic proposal to strengthen treatment for mental health issues failed along with the proposals to strengthen background checks and block people on the terror watch list from purchasing guns and ammunition.\n\nFor almost 20 years, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has not been able to use public funds to research gun violence. It's not an explicit ban on gun violence research, but since 1996, Congress has barred the CDC from using federal funding for what it considers to be advocating for gun control.\n\nThe lack of funding has left many questions on gun violence unanswered. Rep. David Price, D-North Carolina told CBS News that he'd like to find out more about which populations are most affected by gun violence, as well as \"the causes, domestic circumstances, the situation with respect to local laws and law enforcement practices. How is that related to the incidence of gun violence? And then what kind of preventive measures might mitigate this?\"\n\nRep. Nita Lowey, D-New York seconded that, telling CBS News, \"When you see statistics that say thousands of deaths occur a day as a result of gun violence, we need to know why, how, where, when and so I want to leave it to the CDC to determine why these numbers are so very high.\"\n\nHours before the shooting in San Bernardino, a petition signed by 2,000 physicians was presented to Democrat lawmakers in Washington, calling for the removal of the restriction.\n\nThere may also be ways to make guns less dangerous to store. New technology in \"smart guns\" recognizes the owners' fingerprints or hand grip or has other features controlled by the owner, so firearms can't be stolen or accidentally fired by a child.\n\nThose guns are not currently mass-produced in the U.S., a recent \"60 Minutes\" report found, in part because of fears that they might lead to greater gun control.\n\nThe Obama administration also dropped plans to try to ban a type of ammunition called green-tip bullets that can pierce a police officer's protective vest if fired from a handgun after facing major criticism. Handgun ammunition that can pierce body armor has been illegal since 1986, but green-tipped rifle bullets were considered an exception because of their use in sport shooting.\n\nA high-capacity magazine ban, which could limit the number of bullets in a magazine dramatically, has been considered in Congress but has not passed. Eight states and the District of Columbia have these bans in place, and California may also have a ballot initiative on this in 2016.\n\nThen there's an outright ban on assault rifles. A 1994 law banning weapons like AK-47s expired in 2004, and efforts to renew it - including one in 2013 after Newtown - have all failed.\n\nLegislators could also look at ways to try to crack down on illegal gun sales. This would involve a gun trafficking statute, \"so you can go up to people who are buying guns in big quantities and selling on the street, going after gun stores that make a lot of illegal sales, going after what are called straw purchasers\" - people who purchase guns for others, Kessler said.\n\nSome governors have taken action to do this on the state level. For example, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe signed an executive order to crack down on criminality after a TV reporter and cameraman were shot to death during a live television broadcast earlier this year. His executive orders aimed to increase prosecutions of gun crimes, encourage reporting of those crimes, and to trace all guns used to commit a crime.",

The star of \"Contraband\" and several friends had been booked on Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles, which crashed into the World Trade Center, but they changed their reservations when plans changed.\n\n“If I was on that plane with my kids, it wouldn’t have went down like it did,” Wahlberg said. “There would have been a lot of blood in that first-class cabin and then me saying, ‘OK, we’re going to land somewhere safely, don’t worry.’”\n\nDeena Burnett-Bailey's husband Thomas Burnett phoned her from the doomed Flight 93, saying, \"I know we're going to die.

        "instruction": "On the first hole of the Travelers Championship, my first PGA Tour event, I have a case of the rookie jitters. I've gone through the training and a practice round. I feel confident that I'm lined up perfectly on the tee. But I know that if my first stroke goes awry, my entire tournament could be in peril. I need to get off to a perfect start.\n\nAnd I do. As soon as PGA Tour player John Merrick smashes his drive down the middle of the fairway of the first hole on the TPC River Highlands in Cromwell, Conn., I enter his stroke into my handheld Symbol device. I do the same when Garrett Willis, then Mark Brooks, also find the fairway with their drives. I follow them as they stroll off the tee to scattered applause from fans gathered on the outside of the ropes.\n\nIt's not exactly what I pictured as a 10 year-old in my backyard pretending to hit wedges into the 18th green at Augusta. But walking behind three professional golfers at a tournament and recording their every stroke as a ShotLink volunteer is pretty cool nonetheless.\n\nShotLink, the PGA Tour's statistical system, was launched 10 years ago, and put into full-time use on the tour in 2003. In the past, recording players' scoring metrics was a seriously low-tech affair. Plus, there were only a few metrics scored (like driving distance, greens in regulation and putts). \"The walkers used to mark a sheet of paper and hand it to a little old lady by the green of each hole,\" says Scott Ross, ShotLink's operations head.\n\nIn Pictures: High-Tech Golf Gadgets\n\nBut no more, thanks to a command center armed with networked computers, 36 lasers strategically placed on tripods throughout the course, and walking scorers who manually input the number of strokes and the type of lies (fairway, green, bunker, rough) into a handheld device. Instead of five or six basic stats, ShotLink provides more than 600. Years after the Bill Jamesian statistical revolution took hold in baseball, it has begun in professional golf, thanks to ShotLink.\n\nWant to know if Tiger is more likely to spray his drives to the right or the left? (Answer: the right.) Or what Phil's scoring average is on par 5 holes? (4.54, second on the tour.) Or how about the number of feet Kenny Perry converted in his putts en route to winning last year's Travelers Championship? (98 feet.) ShotLink will tell you all of that and a lot more.\n\nAll of the real-time statistics and scoring generated are piped into PGATour.com and used by Jim Nantz, Nick Faldo and Johnny Miller on TV broadcasts. ShotLink partners with CDW ( CDWC - news - people ), which provided hardware and software. ShotLink is wholly owned by the tour.\n\nShotLink is used at every PGA Tour stop, at all World Golf events and at the PGA Championship. (It's not used at the US or British Opens or on the LPGA or Champions Tours.) The tour employs a full-time ShotLink staff of 14 who travel to tour courses a few weeks ahead of an event. There they do GPS surveys of the courses, set up networks, position the lasers and find volunteers to operate them, as well as to walk the courses as scorers.",

        "instruction": "In January, National Basketball Retired Players Association President & CEO Arnie Fielkow was discussing the stigma of NBA players blowing away their millions with reckless spending. Fielkow said it was a result of how NBA players are groomed.\n\nIn their early teens, players hit the AAU circuit and surpass childhood. Prep and college coaches court them, followed by NBA scouts and executives. \"Basketball becomes a job in some guys' early teens,\" said Fielkow, previously an executive vice president of the New Orleans Saints and New Orleans city council president,\n\nBy the time players retire from professional basketball, they move on to a life with considerably less income and little financial knowledge.\n\nWhile LeBron James would not have blown away his fortune after his playing career, he needed basketball to be something more than a job. He needed a learning experience before retirement. This is why he spent four years studying in Miami.\n\nIn James' first-person Sports Illustrated piece published Friday, the Cleveland Cavaliers-returnee said:\n\nLet's put ourselves in LeBron's shoes. He was raised by a single mother in Akron, Ohio. He starred on the AAU circuit in middle school for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars. Along with his three AAU teammates, Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III and Willie McGee, he enrolled at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School, a predominantly white school. In high school, James' games were moved to college arenas to accommodate attendance. His team traveled around the country and they were featured on national television.\n\nHe was drafted by the hometown Cleveland Cavaliers. It set up a fairy-tale script that appeared to progress toward the franchise's first NBA title. For seven years, James kept the plot moving. He became international megastar while playing for a middle market. He led the Cavs to their first Eastern Conference title, he won an Olympic gold medal and he earned two NBA MVPs.\n\nBut at heart, James was still a kid. He never had the intermediate period most adults have. He never had the opportunity to fool around with his peers. He never had the opportunity to make mistakes. He never had the opportunity to hide from the media.\n\nAnd he never had the opportunity to leave Northeast Ohio.\n\nWhen James became a free agent in 2010, his value was at a peak -- not just monetarily. This was James' chance to get whatever he wanted beyond money. He could play with whom he wanted and where he wanted. He could earn the allegiance of a population of people in whatever American city he signed in.\n\nAnd he could experience something different.\n\nFor James, this was a decision like choosing a college town, going on a Eurotrip or pursuing a career in a new city. James could experience a new taste of American life in a new place with new people.\n\nMiami was right for him. It was livelier than Cleveland. It had a front office with Pat Riley that would treat him like a big market player. It had players who could help him win a title, including two superstars willing to play second and third fiddle to The King.\n\nThe problem with the 2010 offseason was James was still a kid. He openly admitted, and do so again in his SI article, that he handled free agency the wrong way. It was The Bachelor -- NBA Edition. Teams and fans salivated over James. He forced the Cavs to beg on their hands and knees the same way other franchises did. When he made his announcement, he called for \"The Decision\" and embarrassed his former team on national television. He then took his talents to Miami clubs to show off his new jersey with his new teammates. James basked in the flashiness of Miami and the media attention that followed the \"Big Three.\"\n\nLike any sabbatical (in this case, a break from a city), the fun comes to an end. James blew off steam early in his Miami career, but it got old. The \"Should I Be Who You Want Me to Be?\" persona faded off. James' advertisements featured his family, not his ego. His supporting cast, notably Dwyane Wade's knees, faded. In his final season in Miami, James lifted the Heat out of a depleted Eastern Conference one last time. The NBA Finals were a reminder the 2013-14 Heat team did not have the pizzazz of the past two teams. The story was old and the plot was not as fun anymore.\n\nJames never stopped being a child at heart. There is a reason James always refers to himself as \"just a kid from Akron, Ohio.\" He has never wanted to be anything more. He is a family man. He married his high school sweetheart and has always kept his mother close. With all the chaos of NBA free agency, James still found time to go fishing with his children.\n\nOne of the lasting images of James will be his ecstasy as he closed in on his first title with Miami. So much of James' public presence is defined by the cameras around him. On that evening, James was as free-spirited as could be. It was part of his Miami vacation.\n\nAfter four years, the fun dwindled. For 25 years, James fit the mold of the player Fielkow described. He was a kid who starred in his youth and never had a chance to experience life outside of basketball. In Miami, James had an educational experience. For four years, he learned about another type of American lifestyle. He lived in the Heat of Miami for a big money franchise in a party town. He enjoyed it, but he realized it was not his long-term home.\n\nJames never sold his Akron home and he kept his foundation, the LeBron James Family Foundation, in Akron. In the SI piece, he says he always expected to bring his life back to Cleveland. He also says, \"This is what makes me happy.\"\n\nIt is hard to understand LeBron James from an outsider's perspective. James can own the biggest cities in the world, but it is not what he wants. He wants to go back to his Midwest roots. James does not need the biggest mansion or the most fancy cars in Cleveland (of course he'll have those). After a fun four years away, he just wants the warmth of home, and, the ability to win a championship for his city.\n\nJames admits 2010 was tough for him. He played it cool and acted like he did not care, but apparently \"The Decision\" was made James anxious. \"What if I were a kid who looked up to an athlete, and that athlete made me want to do better in my own life, and then he left? How would I react?\" James wrote in SI about Dan Gilbert's letter, the booing and the jersey burnings.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is easy to blame James for the way he handled his move from Cleveland to Miami. Despite his age, he cannot defend the immaturities he displayed in 2010. He was right to join the Heat. Wade, Chris Bosh and others gave James a chance to win NBA titles. He won two rings and four conference championships. If he stayed in Cleveland, he may not have a title today.\n\nIt is refreshing to see James man up and admit all this. In one article, James summed up the past four years of his life. We waited four years to hear the inside story of \"The Decsion.\" James informed us in a few paragraphs.\n\nHe did not reference his \"talents.\" He said he wants to bring a title back to Cleveland. He is not projecting eight championships. Although I disagree with James that he cannot win now (his supporting cast in Cleveland may turn out better than Miami), he says it make take a few years to build a contender on his old team. James' humility is something we did not see four years ago.\n\nEarlier this week, I advised Cleveland fans to be cautious about forgiving James. I felt if James returned to Cleveland, he would need to earn his city's trust back. Well, he did. He did it damn well. He admitted his mistakes. He put everything out in the open. Four years ago, he needed an excursion to a new city with a new team. Now, he is 29-going-on-30 and ready to come home. He is still the kid from Akron and his passion has never been greater.\n\nCleveland's kid will be a 30-year-old man this time around. Four years ago, calling James a man would have been ridiculous. Now, he is a strong-willed adult. James needed four years to blow off steam. He made mistakes and lost some fans in the process. But this week, he sat down with Lee Jenkins and poured it all out.\n\nThe world does not need to become LeBron fans again. But damn it, we have to respect him.\n\n-- Follow Jeffrey Eisenband on Twitter @JeffEisenband.\n\nLike us on facebook, follow us on twitter, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.\n\nVIDEO OF THE DAY:Doing The Mike Trout Workout",

        "instruction": "PHOENIX -- The Diamondbacks had done everything to ensure their starting pitching staff was healthy entering the 2015 season. After a 5-2 loss Wednesday to the San Francisco Giants, any long-term health worries involve the bullpen, and only because the starters have yet to prove they can take a game beyond the fifth inning.\n\nThis time around, Jeremy Hellickson took a loss in his first start of the year by allowing nine hits and three earned runs. He needed 91 pitches to get through 4-1/3 innings, and the damage could've been worse had the Giants not stranded 12. Location was an issue from the get-go.\n\n\"I only threw a handful of pitches where I wanted,\" Hellickson said. \"When I did get ahead of guys, then I made a lot of bad two-strike pitches.\"\n\nHellickson first found trouble in the second. Nori Aoki doubled to left-center to score Brandon Crawford, and Matt Duffy followed with another double to score Aoki.\n\nAfter the Giants kept Hellickson busy in the third and fourth innings, neither of which yielded runs, third baseman Casey McGehee doubled to begin the fifth. Crawford knocked in an RBI single to make it 3-1 and Hellickson was pulled for Daniel Hudson.\n\nAnd so continued the trend for the D-backs starters, who haven't gotten more out of a starting pitcher than Rubby De La Rosa's 5-1/3 innings on Tuesday. That's meant the bullpen has, as the team feared, been forced to go longer than manager Chip Hale would like.\n\nHale said he thought the starters have been too amped up, too anxious to prove themselves. Hale hopes they can learn to relax and play within themselves.\n\n\"If we just give the bullpen a little rest ... start going a little deeper in the game and get those guys some days off, they're going to be really good,\" Hellickson said. \"I think we'll start that in the next couple days.\"\n\nThe D-backs' bullpen, however, has played well while leaned on. Its first 11-2/3 innings this season were scoreless until, with Arizona trailing just 3-2 in the ninth inning Wednesday, McGehee belted a two-run home run off Evan Marshall.\n\nThe loss could be viewed as a missed opportunity for Arizona. Rather than facing San Francisco's expected third starter, Matt Cain, who is on the disabled list with a flexor tendon strain, pitcher Chris Heston took home his first career victory. He went six innings, allowing two unearned runs and struck out five.\n\n\"He did a hell of a job,\" Hale said. \"We have good hitters, I don't question them one bit. Obviously his ball was moving and his breaking ball had the illusion of a strike.\n\n\"He would flip it over early in the count and make us cognizant and then ... threw it in the dirt, threw it out of the zone and we were chasing,\" Hale added.\n\nArizona managed five hits on the night to 14 for San Francisco.\n\nThe D-backs' two scores did come by way of Heston mistakes -- but ones more likely due to Heston losing focus in his first significant major league start. In the first inning, leadoff man A.J. Pollock reached after being hit by a pitch. After rounding the bases when Heston threw a pickoff at first that went astray, the outfielder scored from third on a Chris Owings ground-out.\n\nAnd when Arizona found itself trailing 3-1 in the sixth, first baseman Paul Goldschmidt doubled to lead off the inning, advanced to third on Heston's wild pitch, and soon after, slid home on a passed ball. Otherwise, the D-backs couldn't figure out the young pitcher.\n\n\"He did a good job of spotting in and out (of the zone),\" said the D-backs Mark Trumbo, who didn't record a hit after recording two triples in as many games heading into the series finale. \"I think what made it even better was his breaking ball. Tough to pick up, tough to lay off. We just didn't make an adjustment quick enough. Credit to him.\"\n\nOutfielder Cody Ross, who the D-backs released on Saturday, made his debut for the Oakland A's on Wednesday, going 1-for-5 with two RBI.\n\n5 -- Giants shortstop Brandon Crawford sliced up Arizona for five hits and four RBI in three games.\n\n* Hale started everyone except catcher/infielder Jordan Pacheco in the three-game series. The D-backs will continue to roll with a new look every night to keep all the players in a groove, Hale said. It's similar to the frequent lineup changes with Hale's former team in Oakland. \"I think with the As, the majority of those guys were older guys who had been around,\" Hale said. \"There, it was that fit -- right versus left, left versus right -- a guy like A.J. Pollock can hit right or left, it's not that (here). It's just about getting another guy at-bats that day, so it's kind of harder to swallow this point in their careers. But they've been good about it so far.\"\n\n* David Peralta broke up Heston's no-hit bid in the fourth inning with a single. According to Hale, opposing pitchers have been \"testing\" Peralta, who against right-handers has fit well fourth in the lineup, between Paul Goldschmidt and Mark Trumbo. Hale wants to make teams think twice about pitching around Goldschmidt, and it paid off Tuesday when Peralta launched a three-run homer. To that point in the MLB season, it was the longest (442.4 feet) and second-fastest off the bat (115.3 mph), per BaseballSavant.com.\n\n* Hellickson became the third D-backs starter that failed to reach six innings, but like Josh Collmenter and Rubby De La Rosa before him, it could've been much worse. In the first, he stranded Nori Aoki on third with a strikeout and a forced ground out. Three innings later, Hellickson got out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam -- courtesy a strong stop on a hard hit toward Jake Lamb at third -- went the Giants could only muster a grounder that led to a force-out and then a lineout by Buster Posey.\n\n* San Francisco wins in Arizona.

It had initially included certain sizes of Gold Medal, Wondra, and Signature Kitchens brand flour that had been produced between Nov. 4, 2015 and Dec. 4, 2015. The company announced in a press release on Monday that it is extending the affected production dates included in the recall through February 10, 2016.\n\nThis comes after the company confirmed four new illnesses that could be related to the recall. The illnesses have been linked to General Mills gis customers who have eaten or improperly handled raw dough or batter made with the affected products. “At this time, it is unknown if we are experiencing a higher prevalence of E. coli in flour than normal, if this is an issue isolated to General Mills’ flour, or if this is an issue across the flour industry,” the company wrote in the press release.\n\nGeneral Mills reminds its customers that flour is made from wheat grown outside, where it can be exposed to certain kinds of bacteria. The cooking process can help kill bacteria, so you shouldn’t eat anything that contains raw flour.\n\nThis is the second time that the company is expanding the recall since it was initiated in May. Earlier this month General Mills announced that it was recalling three flavors of Betty Crocker cake mix that were made with Wondra flour that had been named in the original recall.\n\nA spokesperson for General Mills told Fortune that retailers have been notified, and the additional flour will quickly be removed from shelves.",

        "instruction": "The operators of a Western Massachusetts power plant have agreed to plead guilty and pay $8.5 million for tampering with air pollution monitoring equipment and reporting false data about emissions levels, US Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz announced Wednesday.\n\nBetween January 2009 and March 2011, employees at Berkshire Power in Agawam manipulated the emissions monitoring system to conceal the fact that the plant was emitting an excess of pollutants. The plant did this to avoid shutting down to make repairs needed to keep it within pollution limits, according to the Department of Justice.\n\nA shutdown would have cut into the plant’s profits, prosecutors said.\n\nThe staff also lied about the plant’s availability to produce power for the New England grid, investigators found.\n\nIn doing so, the plant’s owner, Berkshire Power Co., and manager, Power Plant Management Services, violated the federal Clean Air Act. The management company also violated the Federal Power Act for lying to the regional power grid administrator — the first-ever criminal charges under the statute, according to the Department of Justice.\n\n“The deliberate scheme Berkshire Power Plant management and staff undertook gave them an unfair competitive advantage over responsible companies and undermined a system that depends on honest data reporting,” Tyler Amon, special agent in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency’s criminal investigation division in Boston, said in a statement. “Maximizing profit to minimize the cost of controlling pollution is placing greed over protecting nearby communities.”\n\nPower Plant Management Services declined to comment on the settlement.\n\n“It’s still an ongoing legal matter,” said William Freddo, the company’s projects general manager.\n\nBerkshire Power Co., founded in 1998, operates a 245-megawatt combined-cycle natural gas power plant, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThis type of emissions fraud is an anomaly, said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association, who compared it to Volkswagen’s admission that it equipped 11 million vehicles with software used to cheat on emissions tests.\n\nPower plant emissions have been cut drastically in recent years through environmental upgrades and a transition to cleaner fuels such as natural gas and renewable energy, Dolan said. Since 1999, he said, power plants in New England have increased their efficiency by 22 percent, which has also reduced emissions.\n\nNew England Power Generators Association represents about 85 percent of the electricity generation capacity in the region, which has between 300 and 400 power plants, Dolan said. Berkshire Power is not among its members.\n\n“We’re seeing substantial emissions reductions across the power generation fleet,” he said. “For those folks who don’t follow the rules, there are very real punishments that exist.”\n\nExceeding allowed pollution levels can cause serious health problems and environmental damage, the Department of Justice noted. Excess nitrogen oxide emitted by power plants and automobiles combines with other organic compounds to form ground-level ozone, which can lead to respiratory problems, particularly in children and the elderly, and can damage aquatic life and coastal waters.\n\n“This resolution addresses a pattern of behavior by multiple persons and entities in obstructing the enforcement of laws designed to protect the air we breathe,” Ortiz said in a statement.\n\nJust over a year ago, Ortiz’s office filed charges against a manager and technician who worked at the plant when the tampering took place. The men were employed by the plant’s then day-to-day operations company, formerly called Wood Group Power Plant Services, and were directed by a Power Plant Management Services manager to tinker with the emissions monitoring system, according to the Justice Department.\n\nThe Wood Group, now called EthosEnergy, revealed the tampering to state and federal regulators and cooperated during the case, and the case against the company is being resolved with a $1.1 million civil settlement.\n\nSome of the settlement money will go toward installing electric-vehicle charging stations in Massachusetts and funding an American Lung Association program to replace inefficient wood stoves with EPA-certified wood, gas, and pellet stoves.",

        "instruction": "FOR his professional New York stage debut, which took place in a 1994 Off Broadway curiosity called \"Judy at the Stonewall Inn,\" Mark Kassen wore gold lamé hot pants and danced in a cage. His parents, who schlepped in from Syracuse for the occasion, survived. A few years later, when he was cast in a play called \"Things You Shouldn't Say Past Midnight,\" they endured his appearance, totally nude, in bed with a shiksa. They were tolerant people, after all; they had watched him in an episode of \"Cybill.\" But Mr. Kassen may finally have gone too far, even for his loving and broadminded folks. Monday night he opens as Hitler.\n\nNot Hitler, exactly -- or not that Hitler. In \"Little Willy,\" which Mr. Kassen researched and wrote over the course of six years, he plays William Patrick Hitler, born in 1911 to the Führer's half-brother, Alois, and an Irish woman named Brigid Dowling. Accurate as far as the evidence goes, and astutely imagined when evidence is lacking, \"Little Willy\" dramatizes the young man's attempts to trade on his family name, first as a salesman in prewar Germany, where he played up his closeness to the chancellor, and then on American lecture tours that advertised \"his daring exposé of intrigue among the enslavers of Europe.\" Even then, the play suggests, he was not averse to turning on the old Hitler charm if it meant a chance at hobnobbing with the horsy set or bedding a starlet.\n\n\"It's about the advertising of panache without substance,\" Mr. Kassen said: an account of a young opportunist's pathetic self-marketing but also, by implication, a reflection on his infamous relative's more successful efforts in the same line. Concentrating on the period from 1936 to 1943, \"Little Willy\" tells the true story of its title character's efforts to extort a better job from Uncle Adolf and then, after leaving Germany in a huff and petitioning President Franklin D. Roosevelt, to serve in the United States military. More speculatively, Mr. Kassen shows him selling Volkswagens and Beech-Nut gum and, most of all, himself, to women who inevitably find him disappointing -- hence the play's title, an allusion to the family habit of overcompensation.\n\nBut the story is jolted out of its oddly comfortable historical frame by the news, delivered almost as an afterthought as the play ends, that Mr. Hitler, having become an American citizen in 1944, did a stint in the Navy and then moved to Sunnyside, Queens. Soon afterward, with a new last name, he married and had four sons, three of whom, now middle-aged men, are apparently still living on Long Island.\n\nWait: the Führer's kin on Long Island? The information is rattling. It's not that anyone could ever have said, \"Honey, go play next door with those nice Hitler boys.\" The family has maintained and, when necessary, protected its anonymity. But just knowing that the last remnants of the most famously evil name in modern history (no other relatives are thought to have survived the war) might be pushing the next cart at the Office Max in Melville makes the membrane between the unsettling past and the familiar present begin to vibrate.\n\nIf the vibration is somewhat titillating, that's because the membrane hasn't shattered; discovering real storm troopers on the cul-de-sac might not seem so jolly. It's just the right level of creepiness to know -- as Mr. Kassen discovered in his research -- that the new last name Mr. Hitler chose for himself, upon his naturalization, is only a slight alteration of the name of an English anti-Semite whose writings helped shape early Nazi ideology. Or that, having settled in perhaps the most densely Jewish part of the country, he gave his eldest son the middle name Adolf.\n\nSo his renunciation of his heritage was a tad ambivalent; still, it's an American principle that the sins of the father (or great half-uncle) ought not be visited on the sons. In any case, though Mr. Hitler eventually found work as a freelance phlebotomist, his boys took up the kind of labor that almost seems reparative: law enforcement, counseling Vietnam War veterans, landscaping. In a culture of celebrity-by-association, and even celebrity-by-awfulness, their very attempt at anonymity, understandable though it is, makes them more fascinating. Willful obscurity has become suspicious; if Hitlers are living obscurely among us, shouldn't they be found?\n\nBut Mr. Kassen, who with his younger brother now runs an independent film production company, was not interested in that sort of detective work, hunting his subject to the end of the trail, which in this case turned out to be the Long Island Expressway. At first, all he wanted was an interesting, age-appropriate role to play. (He is 34.) Chancing upon a reference to Mr. Hitler in an article, he became fascinated by the acting challenge: the Irish accent, the period style, the Adolfian echoes. (During one of Mr. Hitler's spiels for Colgate toothpaste, Mr. Kassen manages to incorporate a sly version of the Reich salute.) And, as a writer, he found the story of a man with no particular talent or identity of his own, a man willing to embrace (or cast off) anything to acquire even a morsel of importance, \"very relevant\" to the current moment. \"Here, long before Paris Hilton or Kato Kaelin, long before bin Laden's niece tried to cut a record,\" Mr. Kassen said, \"was a window into our own world.\"\n\nAs such, his historical research kept being sidetracked into the present. He viewed newsreels of Adolf Hitler and films of Charlie Chaplin, Clark Gable, Errol Flynn: men whose style Mr. Hitler seemed to imitate. But he also watched clips of contemporary salesmen like Deepak Chopra and Tony Robbins. In color-coded journals and on three-by-five cards (blue for historical facts, fluorescent green for modern parallels) he redacted his reading. He found Brigid Dowling's diary in the New York Public Library. A 1939 \"Look\" article by Mr. Hitler himself, titled \"Why I Hate My Uncle,\" provided useful details about his character's preoccupations. Among the turn-offs cited are the Führer's \"feminine gestures\" and the dandruff on his coat.\n\nBut Mr. Kassen's high-minded research inevitably brought him in contact with less reputable sources and subjects, to the point of making him and those around him uncomfortable. He noticed that other customers in the coffee shops where he likes to write were looking at him oddly; he learned to keep the covers of the books he was reading -- with their prominent iconography -- hidden. \"And when my girlfriend first came to visit me in Los Angeles,\" he remembered, \"I had to explain why 'Mein Kampf' was on my bedside table.\" Even buying swastika armbands for the show led him down dark alleys; the theatrical costuming Web sites he found required proof that customers were doing legitimate plays like \"The Sound of Music.\" So Mr. Kassen got the armbands \"elsewhere\" on the Internet. \"For all the weird hate sites I got into,\" he said, \"I'm probably going to be in Guantánamo by the end of the play.\"\n\nBut the deeper he delved into the story, the more the fact of the living descendants (William Patrick Hitler died in 1987, at age 76) gnawed at him. He was, at first, reluctant to look for them. \"Not that I could imagine that they were going to come out of hiding to sue me for defamation,\" he said, \"but stranger things have happened. Why prod the sleeping giant?\" Still, he said, the actor's impulse to assemble a character from as much information as possible and the writer's need to distinguish among the man's many contradictory poses eventually got the better of him. Did Mr. Hitler really renounce his heritage? Did his three sons, as has been variously reported and disputed among Hitlerologists -- and as Mr. Kassen states in his play -- really make a pact not to marry or have children, so the bloodline would end? \"I just needed to know there was a pretty good chance it was all true.\"\n\nThough by his own admission no scholar -- learning disabilities were what led him, he said, to acting in the first place -- he worked like an obsessed journalist. \"If you find out that somebody does something and has a first name, you can crash databases and get more information,\" he said. \"For instance, I knew he had four kids and then learned that the youngest one, named Howard, died in a car crash on Long Island. So I could find that in newspaper death records. After all, how many people named Howard died in a car crash on Long Island in that particular year? And from that I got their last name. From another source I learned that the oldest son worked for a Veterans Administration hospital on Long Island. Now I had his full name -- and how many V.A. hospitals do you think there are on Long Island?\"\n\nAs it turns out, there's one, and Mr. Kassen called its business affairs office. That's when he was, as he put it, \"deterred.\"\n\nHe is circumspect about the details. \"Let's just say I was contacted by someone's attorney asking me, in a nonthreatening but really assertive way, to respectfully stay away from the family. I had already found out what I needed to know for the purposes of my play, that the three sons were living where I said they were. And I don't see what great good it does for the world to pursue them. Think of the legal mess. Hitler -- I mean Adolf Hitler -- had assets that were never claimed. Who would it serve to bring all that out?\"\n\nAnd yet there was one thing Mr. Kassen needed to see for himself: little Willy's grave. So on a spring day in 2003, he headed out to a Long Island cemetery. The monument -- to William Patrick and his mother, who is buried with him -- was unremarkable: a simple arched stone carved with ivy and a cross. Beneath their adopted surname in large letters, and above their given names, is only the inscription \"Rest in Peace.\" Which Mr. Kassen took as a general imperative; he would not show a reporter the photo he snapped that day.\n\nBecause Adolf Hitler has no grave, his nephew's headstone is likely \"the only memorial to that bloodline,\" Mr. Kassen said. \"It was more exciting than weird. I felt, at best, a little clever for having found it. I guess I had wanted to watch the train wreck, to see where that disastrous train ended up.\"\n\nRaised in what he called a \"culturally observant\" Jewish home, Mr. Kassen said he has recently become \"a more active nonparticipant.\" As much as anyone does, he finds the history of the Hitlers disturbing. Yet by investigating and embodying a part of it, he has also made it seem oddly ordinary. Is it the hope that the last century's outsized horror is past -- or the fear that it isn't -- that allows it to be domesticated? Mr. Kassen said that his father always found sitcoms like \"Hogan's Heroes\" offensive, as many do \"The Producers,\" for their defanged, lovable Nazis; what would such people think of \"Little Willy,\" which achieves a lot of its humor and power through the contrast between the offstage nightmare of the \"real\" Hitler and the onstage antics of his ineffectual nephew, hawking a Hoover Deluxe 4000?\n\n\"Nowadays we channel surf through tragedy,\" Mr. Kassen said. \"I'm no better. But you draw the line somewhere. I didn't want to walk up to one of the sons with a videocam and 'get' him; that would be the same as what Willy did. Trying to make myself known by exploiting someone else's name.\"\n\nNevertheless, that's what's happening, to some extent and however artfully, in \"Little Willy\" -- and, one might as well admit, in this article about it. Theater is at least partly showmanship, as William Patrick Hitler well knew, reshaping his mustache, his politics, his very name to suit the life he sought. (And, by the way, it doesn't take much sleuthing to discover that Mr. Kassen, too, has changed his surname, from Krassenbaum.) Would \"Little Willy\" have been as noticeable if it were about some lesser evil man's nephew? Or, more to the point, some saint's? \"We all trade what we have for what we want,\" Mr. Kassen said, providing an epitaph for his character if not his age. \"And sometimes what we have isn't very nice.\"",

        "instruction": "SOMERVILLE — The California quintet Ceremony formed in 2005, and its early records were marked by bracing rage — brief, potent onslaughts of brute-force guitars and vocalist Ross Farrar’s scraped-paint vocals yelling about various forms of alienation, all designed to ignite and direct explosive reactions from anyone who might be nearby. But on its most recent album, “The L-Shaped Man,” Ceremony expressed its dissatisfactions differently.\n\nA meditation on the aftermath of heartbreak, “L-Shaped,” which came out in May, certainly possesses the bleakness that characterizes the band’s earlier work. Musically, however, it brings to mind the earliest days of post-punk melding into New Wave — brooding basslines, spindly solos, lyrics that probe the way heartbreak can feel deepest at the most mundane moments. Guitars are given just enough reverb to sound like they’re emanating from the bottom of caverns; the record frequently incorporates elements of faster, happier brands of rock, twisting them just enough to make them sound like they represent embittered memories of better times.\n\nOn Sunday, the band split the difference between its earlier, fiercer material and the more expansive songs from “The L-Shaped Man.” Farrar’s performance stance was similar to that of a street fighter, poised and ready for all comers; it fit his lyrical subject matter regardless of whether he was singing about lost love (the dominant topic of “The L-Shaped Man”) or the police. It was also appropriate given the nature of the crowd, which swelled toward the front or made space for a mosh pit, depending on each song’s opening chords; on the harder offerings, people leapt from the stage in hopes of securing a spot to surf above the pulsing crowd, and Farrar and lead guitarist Anthony Anzaldo got in on the high-wire action as well.\n\nCeremony’s taut, well-paced set ended with “Sick,” a blistering 2010 track that very bluntly sums up being “sick of” the world; among the recorded version’s targets are “television,” “yuppies,” and (perhaps inevitably) “me.” The final pit of the night was marked by Farrar passing the mike around to audience members so they could also yell “SICK!!” into it; as a gesture, it not only got the braver audience members to push toward the front even harder, it summed up the appeal of Ceremony’s ability to channel and reflect alienation.\n\nWith Pity Sex, Tony Molina\n\nAt: Cuisine en Locale, Sunday",

        "instruction": "Art, wrote Edvard Munch, \"is the pictorial form created by the human nerves – the heart – the brain – the eye.\" As a young man in Norway in the late 1880s he set out a manifesto for an art of passion.\n\n\"We want more than a mere photograph of nature. We do not want to paint pretty pictures to be hung on drawing room walls. We want to create, or at least to lay the foundations of, an art that gives something to humanity. An art that arrests and engages. An art created of one's innermost heart.\"\n\nLike Van Gogh, he wanted to make passionate images of human beings and nature for a secular world, to replace the old religious images. Over his life time he worked and reworked a series of paintings he called The Frieze of Life. Among these were Puberty, Jealousy, Vampire, The Kiss, Madonna, Sphinx, Anxiety, Melancholy, The Dance of Life, Ashes, The Scream. They were painted initially in the 1890s. They are compelling and frequently appalling. The curators of the new exhibition at Tate Modern, Angela Lampe and Clément Chéroux, point out in their catalogue that three-quarters of Munch's output dates from after 1900, most particularly from between 1913 and 1930. Edvard Munch: The Modern Eye is an exhibition of Munch's modern consciousness, and the catalogue analyses his artistic intelligence, his construction of optical space, his relationship with the spectator, his work, in the early days of photography and film, on the reproducibility of images. The authors are not claiming that the modern Munch was less passionate than the symbolist. They are showing how he found new ways of exploring the human nerves, the heart, the brain, the eye. The catalogue is fascinating and full of new ways of looking and thinking.\n\nMunch's is a world full of the ultimate human things – sickness, death, sex, fear, desire, hatred and destruction. His rooms are furnished with dark, solid beds seen from all angles – deathbeds, sickbeds surrounded by those about to become mourners or by mourners, sex beds in which encounters have happened or will happen, beds in which the onlooker can see parts of the corpse of a murdered person while the murderer stares transfixed, the bed in Puberty on which a thin, anxious girl sits with her hands crossed over her genitals. Beside her is a dark shadow, not unlike a magnified image of her own dark hair, which rises like smoke from a point beside her knees. She is unforgettable, as is The Sick Child, an image Munch reworked repeatedly, in both paintings and lithographs. She represents his sister, Sophie, who died when she was 15 and Munch was 13. Looking at these works we are struck by the incongruous liveliness of the child's bright red hair, exactly as we see the tense stillness of the face, the drawn lips. Munch himself described his own struggle to retrieve the image he remembered.\n\nWhen I saw the sick child for the first time – her pale face with vigorous red hair against a white pillow – it made an impression on me, only to disappear as I worked. I painted a good picture on the canvas, but it was a different one. I repainted that picture many times over the years – scraped it off – let it dissolve into layers of paint … I had captured a lot of that first impression, the tremulous mouth, the translucent skin – the tired eyes – but the colours in the painting were not finished – it was pale grey. The painting as a whole was heavy, like lead.\n\nIn 1890 Munch said \"I don't paint what I see – but what I saw\", and this reference to the part played by memory in the construction of his images makes us see them as different from, for instance, Monet's beautiful and terrifying image of his wife Camille, painted as she died. The first Sick Child was painted in 1885-86, and another in 1896, and there are versions in, for instance, 1907, 1925 – six versions in all.\n\nLampe and Chéroux point out that Munch came under attack for making numerous copies of The Sick Child. He defended himself by saying that all the repetitions were an act of memory – a continuous struggle with the motif – a continuing work of art. He pointed out that what he was doing was analogous to Monet's series of haystacks or cathedrals – something seen and recorded at successive times, in successive moods. In a splendid chapter called \"Reworkings\", the authors show how Munch both needed to revisit images and ideas, and was unusually interested in, and sophisticated about, the 20th-century ability to reproduce and record images. I have often, as a writer, wondered what painters feel when they sell a painting. Books proliferate in many forms once they are written. They don't leave the author's possession. Munch records repainting certain images in order still to have one of his own, to think about and remember. Repainting a subject must be a way of both recapturing an idea, and of thinking about it in new ways. Munch painted, for instance, 12 different versions of Vampire – an image of a naked woman with long, wild red hair bent over the dark head of a man whose face is buried in her breasts. Her sharp nose is above his neck and her teeth are presumably buried in it. The background and the subject vary – it is dark and threatening, it is a woodland glade, the woman is more and less animal, the hair is wilder or softer. The effect on the onlooker is to make the image more fixed as it is repeated – there is an archetypal vampire, this is how she is; you can represent her in this way or that but she is constant.\n\nOne of the theoretical problems about repetition and reworking is that of authenticity – what is an original, what is a copy? This, the writers point out, later became involved in the idea of the market value of uniqueness. Munch was able to make a living partly by exhibiting versions of paintings already owned by others. Arnold Böcklin was commissioned to repaint his famous Isle of the Dead by Marie Berna, in memory of her dead husband. The case of Giorgio de Chirico is interesting – his early paintings excited, for instance, the surrealists, with their mysterious settings and symbols. But the surrealists were dismayed when after 1920 the painter began to make copies of his own earlier work, which André Breton and Max Ernst found repellent and lifeless. He also made copies and predated them, selling them fraudulently. Both Munch's copies and De Chirico's were in turn copied by Andy Warhol, that master of the repeated image – he did his own versions of Munch's self-portrait with the skeletal arm, of his ghoulish Madonna, and of The Scream itself. As Lampe and Chéroux say: \"Warhol had understood that Munch's motifs were just as autonomous and free as a Campbell's soup can or a Marilyn image, and could easily be recombined. He recognised their iconic branding, with The Scream standing for fear, Madonna for ecstasy and Self-Portrait for death.\"\n\nMunch used many techniques of what Walter Benjamin called \"mechanical reproduction\" in his essay on \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\". Benjamin argued that the proliferation of images of images – prints, photographs – deprived a work of art of its \"aura\", the sense of power and mystery it had as a unique object of contemplation in societies with religious structures. Benjamin did believe that there still existed \"original\" works of art, which had \"authenticity\". But as the Munch catalogue points out, the dividing line between original and copy was blurring appreciably. The availability of original prints by the artists meant that copies were themselves seen to be original works of art.\n\nMunch made etchings and lithographs of the motifs in his well-known paintings. He also took photographs – both conventional and experimental. He recorded himself – a severe profile, a naked man striding on a beach, wielding a paintbrush and palette, a kind of hazy ectoplasm in a deliberately doubled exposure. He took portraits in which he deliberately moved during the shooting, which he called Metabolism – an image, the catalogue remarks, of \"the transformation of molecules and energy\". He took formal pictures of himself as an inmate of a clinic, taking tea. He took photographs of paintings – of himself, solid and dark, among a group of shadowy painted self-portraits, of the painting of The Sick Child, of himself in bed, one in the series of fateful beds. He painted a sensuous nude with long auburn hair, and photographed the model, standing in the same pose among canvases in the studio. He photographed the truncated skirts and boots of two headless women – the authors suggest that the long shadow that falls across their feet is yet another portion of Munch's self-recording, another hinted self-portrait.\n\nHe learned also from the visual forms of early moving pictures. The cinema and the camera revealed new ways of recording movement – how a galloping horse, or an advancing pedestrian or an animated crowd appear to the camera. These contribute to Munch's compelling representations of space – often receding from a figure or creature which is advancing towards the onlooker and is cut off by the frame of the canvas. The painter somehow stretches the space that funnels into the space of the canvas, making everything rush. There is an extraordinary Galloping Horse, hurtling through snow with huge forequarters and wild mane. The animal's diminished hindquarters are barely visible, and the driver, on a kind of sledge, is dwarfed in a perspective which is vertiginous and abnormal. The effect is heightened by the snowy background, which blurs the structure of the landscape – the charging horse appears to be in its own avalanche of white speed. (It has all the same an anxious and homely face.) Two onlookers stand each side of the slope, parallel to the sides of the frame, intensifying the abnormal space of the gallop and the rushing snow.\n\nSomething similar is going on in one of my favourite pictures in The Frieze of Life, Red Virginia Creeper. A terrible face is just above the bottom of the frame, under a black cap, with greenish flesh and huge, round staring eyes; a neat inverted V of red moustache over a small frightened mouth makes that mouth simultaneously appalled. Behind this head a brownish path recedes and narrows rapidly – rising reddish out of the shoulder of the terrible figure as the swollen shadow rises out of the hip of the clenched girl in Puberty. Behind that is a very solid block of a bourgeois house, and some clean white railings. There are what may be gravestones leaning above the ground level of the house – which has no visible door. The house is blood red. It is the red of virginia creeper – one of the reds of virginia creeper – but it is flat, not leafy, solid like meat. The red has overwhelmed parts of the upper windows. The white shapes of the two lower windows look like coffins or shrouds. Munch's variations on the colour red are among the most staggering things he does. Here is his description of the moment when he decided to paint The Scream: \"One evening I was walking along a road – with the fjord and the town below on the other side. I was sick and tired – I stood for some time looking across the fjord. The sun was setting – the clouds were turning red – like blood. I felt as if a scream was going through nature – I thought I heard a scream. I painted the picture – painted the clouds like real blood. – The colours were screaming. This was the picture The Scream in The Frieze of Life.\"\n\nThese reds are related to the fiery red hair of the sick child and the vampire. They are also related to the face of a repeated image he made late in his life. The subject of Young Woman Weeping by the Bed walks, or stands, naked, with her face bent down, and the face is usually the same blood-red as the creeper – a red maybe of skin bloated by weeping, or a blush of shame or terror?\n\nThe shape of Munch's relationship with the onlooker was also influenced by his venture into stage design. In 1906 he worked in Berlin with the great theatre director, Max Reinhardt, who had opened a new, intimate Kammerspiele (chamber theatre), which was like a room in which the audience was close to the action. Munch designed sets for Ibsen's Ghosts and Hedda Gabler, and had his own studio space where he worked on the Frieze of Life, one version of which was exhibited in the foyers. His set for Ghosts is particularly impressive. He placed a huge black armchair with its back to the audience – representing the space of the unspoken family secrets that drove the action behind it. Reinhardt was enthusiastic about this design. \"The armchair says it all! … And the walls of the rooms in Munch's painting! They are the colour of gum disease. We have to try to find wallpaper in exactly this tone. It will put the actors in the right mood! To come fully into its own, facial expression needs space that is modulated through form, light, and above all, colour.\"\n\nIt was round about that time that Munch remarked of one of his works: \"I have painted a still life as good as any by Cézanne, except that in the background I have painted a murderess and her victim.\" The title is Still Life, the Murderess. I don't know what this would be in the original language. Nature Morte is an even grimmer joke.\n\nThroughout Munch's career he studied himself, implacably, in a series of self-portraits in various media that recorded his ageing and sickness – both mental and physical. In 1930 he had a rupture in the retina of his right eye that led to a haemorrhage. This was his good eye, as the other had been injured in a fight. Munch painted what his eye recorded – the \"inside of sight\" as Max Ernst put it. He painted the \"spots in his vision\", circular, concentrically coloured optical illusions, blood red and bright blue, and an image of the artist in his bed \"seeing\" a floating blue skull with reddened eyehole shadows. He painted also a great illusory bird form – Kneeling Nude with Eagle, in which the creature appears to be attacking the kneeling figure. This unflinching study of the damage is a distant continuation of the fact that when he was first painting The Sick Child he saw his own eyelashes as dark streaks in the upper corner of the image and painted them in too.\n\nThe late portraits, of a thinning, questioning, diminishing figure, still curious about himself and his world, are moving and remarkable. In Self-Portrait between the Clock and the Bed he stands with hanging arms and an almost mild, almost expressionless face between the tall, dark pillar of time and a hospital-like bed, with a white bedspread striped in black and red. He is in shadow. Behind him the space is full of golden light and the wall is studded with paintings and drawings. On the right in a strip of dark is a narrow, moony abstract female nude, suspended in space. Death, painting? It is unforgettable, in its use of space, in its perfectly executed feeling.",

        "instruction": "People misunderstand protein. Yes, adding some to a meal can knock down hunger and keep it at bay, which in turn can help you avoid binge eating or snacking. Protein is also essential for proper cell health, as well as muscle synthesis and recovery. But there’s a limit to how much protein your body can use at any given time—and how much of it you need to feel full, says Douglas Paddon-Jones, a professor of nutrition and metabolism at the University of Texas Medical Branch.\n\n“Unless your physical activity levels are really high, you’re not going to have much benefit going over 30 grams of protein in a meal,” he says. At the same time, your body is pretty inept when it comes to holding onto protein for later use, he explains. (Here’s what happens when you don’t eat enough protein.)\n\nThese facts don’t dovetail with the average American’s protein-consuming habits. “When you look at how most people get their protein, they have very little or none at breakfast,” Paddon-Jones says, “and then dinner is this protein soiree where they consume the bulk of their day’s protein in one big lump.”\n\nA better protein plan: Spread your protein allotment more evenly throughout the day. “I’d like to see people eat more of it in the morning, and cut back at night when stuffing a whole bunch of energy into your meal isn’t going to do you much good,” Paddon-Jones says.\n\nHere, he and other nutrition experts explain some smart ways to add protein to every meal.\n\nEggs (6 grams per egg): They may not be a surprise breakfast food, but Paddon-Jones says eggs are a complete source of essential amino acids and a healthy way to pack protein into your morning meal. If you’re worried about cholesterol, don’t be. The latest evidence suggests the cholesterol in eggs—yes, including the yolks—isn’t a concern—even if you’re eating an egg a day (or two in the morning a few days a week).\n\nFull-Fat Greek Yogurt (17 grams per single serving container): “I’m a big fan of Greek yogurt,” Paddon-Jones says. Other experts agree. Even though the jury’s not out on whether the probiotics in yogurt will help your health, there’s no doubt Greek yogurt is a great source of protein and essential amino acids. All varieties are packed with protein. But research suggests full-fat may be better for your waistline than low- or no-fat types. (Full fat is more filling than low-fat, and also tends to contain less sugar and other additives.)\n\nSoy Milk (8 grams per cup): If you’re hoping to limit or eliminate your consumption of animal foods, soy is one of the few plant-based sources of the full complement of essential amino acids, says Toby Smithson, a registered dietician and a spokesperson for the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Adding soymilk to your smoothie, coffee, or tea is an easy way to inject some healthy protein into your morning.\n\nQuinoa (8 grams per cup): One of the so-called ancient grains, quinoa is an unusually complete plant source of essential amino acids, Smithson says. Especially compared to the popular grains most of us swallow—wheat, corn, rice—quinoa kicks butt in the protein department, concludes a study in the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture. Add some to your salad, or mix some into soup.\n\nAlmond Butter (3.5 grams per Tbsp): Smithson says nuts and nut butters are solid protein sources, and a good bet for lunch. Other experts agree, and many cite almond butter’s generous amounts of healthy fat as a great reason to add it to your diet. Research has linked nut consumption to lower rates of heart disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes. Just look for freshly ground nut butters—not the packaged stuff. If it comes pre-ground in a jar, it may be loaded up with sugar, salt, and other additives, experts warn.\n\nSeeds (4.5 grams per oz): Hemp, chia, and flaxseed are all healthy sources of protein, Smithson says. Added to salads or smoothies, they easily pump up the protein content of your midday meal. (N.B. Some seeds—like flax—require a good grinding to release their healthful nutrients. Buying and consuming them whole may not afford you all their benefits.)\n\nBeans (40 grams per cup): Black. Fava. Garbanzo. Pinto. Kidney. Your options are many, and all are good sources of protein, says Winston Craig, professor emeritus of nutrition at Michigan’s Andrews University. Craig has conducted research into vegan diets, and he says combining beans with whole grains is an easy way to supply your body with the essential protein amino acids it requires without the need for a side of meat or dairy.\n\nTofu (20 grams per cup): For all the same reasons soy milk is a healthy protein-booster at breakfast time, tofu—which is basically curdled, cubed soy milk—is a worthy addition to your dinner plate, Smithson says. There are some lingering questions concerning soy’s possible links to tumors and cancer. But most experts believe there’s not much to worry about—and a lot to like—when it comes to soy.\n\nFish (34 grams per 6 oz serving): Meat, poultry, and fish as more or less synonymous with “protein”—especially among health-conscious Americans. But many of us still opt for beef or chicken instead of halibut or salmon. Considering the abundant research linking a fish-centric Mediterranean style diet to lower rates of many chronic diseases, a portion of protein-packed fish is a healthy addition to any dinner menu.",

        "instruction": "Loitering behind the counter of Damien Hirst's Pharmacy, the Tate-owned 1992 room-sized installation that looks remarkably like an upmarket chemist's shop, I was interrupted by a gallery assistant. She stuck her head around the corner and then was gone. Maybe she wanted to buy some suppositories, but was too shy to ask.\n\nI only came in here myself because I had a headache, after looking at all the eye-test dot paintings that punctuate Hirst's Tate Modern survey show, and catching the whiff from Crematorium, Hirst's 1996 ashtray – huge as a hot tub – filled with shovel-loads of old fag-butts and ash, drug-taking paraphernalia, sweet wrappers and swizzle sticks. I had also got down on my knees to sniff through one of the vents set in the glass walls of his A Thousand Years (1990), trying to determine whether it is a real rotting cow's head in there, lying in its pool of congealed blood. I got a face-full of ammoniac air, the smell of all those flies buzzing around, and the corpses piling up in the insecto-cutor where they are being zapped.\n\nOne wants to write a straightforward review of Hirst's work, but it is almost impossible. What would it be like, I wonder, for someone with no knowledge of his art, let alone his global reputation, to come along and review this show? What would they see? So much has already been said about Hirst, including a great deal by me. How can we see it fresh?\n\nTate curator Ann Gallagher has done her best to strip away the excess and repetition of Hirst's art, but it won't go away. It's what he does. The exhibition opens with works from his student years, the late 1980s. A row of pots and pans hangs on the wall, as in a kitchen, their undersides painted in jolly colours. An empty torso-sized MDF-and-laminate kitchen cabinet sits beside his first homespun spot painting, painted on board, which jostles with wonky, dribbly ovoids. Then come the first medicine cabinets, with their empty boxes and jars of pharmaceuticals. The first time I saw these I must have been wandering around with a clipboard, marking them as an external examiner on the Goldsmiths Fine Art degree course. This was 1989, the year after Hirst had curated his famous Freeze exhibition, and already he and his fellow students, and Goldsmiths itself, were famous.\n\nSynthesising the kind of conceptualism-lite, post-pop appropriation and visual gags that many students (and not just at Goldsmiths) were working through at the time, Hirst was also assimilating his influences. These included Kurt Schwitters' collages, minimalism, Bruce Nauman, Jeff Koons's early Hoovers in their dust-free display cabinets, Jannis Kounellis (whose rotting ox carcasses, hung from rods, had been on stomach-churning display though a hot Barcelona summer in 1989) and Francis Bacon. The shadow of American artist Paul Thek was probably in there, too. Thek once decorated a wax arm with butterfly wings, as well as making boxes which housed what looked like raw meat. Like Hirst, Thek also conflated the plight of the body with religious iconography. Thek's career went off the rails and he died from Aids in 1988, the same year Hirst curated Freeze.\n\nWith its cow's head and flies, A Thousand Years comes not far into Tate Modern's show, Hirst's first in a British museum. Made the year after he left college, this double-vitrine was first shown in the warehouse group show Gambler, in south London. A Thousand Years is still extremely powerful, and still surprising. Clean and dirty, full of life and death, formally shocking and rich, it has an air of maturity and finality. In a recent interview for the exhibition catalogue, Hirst tells Tate director Nicholas Serota that it is still possibly the most exciting thing he has ever made. Hirst recalls that Lucian Freud said to him, about this work, that \"I think you started with the final act, my dear.\"\n\nLittle else Hirst has made is comparable, except perhaps the large, sealed double vitrine from the following year, containing a desk, chair, ashtray and packet of cigarettes (The Acquired Inability to Escape), but even this has the feel of an extrapolation rather than a development. Hirst's shark, The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living, from 1991, seems to have shrunk, and here looks more like a specimen than an open-jawed threat. A recent second version is even smaller in its black-framed aquarium; it looks like a tame dogfish, and I can imagine a Ming vase filled with lilies parked on top of its glossy black tank in some collector's home.\n\nThere's an element of fun in earlier Hirst: the Sigmar Polke-inspired string of sausages in a formaldehyde-filled frame; the ping-pong ball floating on the updraft of a hairdryer angled to the ceiling. When he repeats this last trick some years later with an airborne beach ball, the idea has lost its lightness. And what, in theory, could be lighter than standing among swooping exotic butterflies in Hirst's 1991 installation In and Out of Love, the creatures hatching from pupae stuck to canvases and floating about the room, living and dying in the space? In reality, it's macabre. Some of their fellows are mired in the thick, gloopy monochromes on the walls of the room next door, which evidences the aftermath of the original show's opening party.\n\nThe rest is variation and repetition. Production, in other words: the business of being an artist, and art as business. Hirst's later work might be taken as a critique of the very market that supports him, and the people who buy his work – but I somehow doubt it. Flies begat butterflies, which begat more butterflies. Medicine cabinets begat a whole pharmacy, with endless little pills arranged on shelves. Cabinets begat cabinets, MDF and laminate being replaced by gold-plated steel, nickel and brass. You could stick anything in these cabinets of curiosities and vitrines: medical speculums, nasty operating theatre tools, row after row of man-made diamonds, sheep, cows, Havana cigars – now, why not a human corpse? (Go on, you know you want to.)\n\nThis exhibition charts a great descent in Hirst's art, one that mirrors the ascent of his bankability and the creation of ever more decadent and overblown artefacts. I have enjoyed some things – if enjoy is the right word for paintings covered in a crust of dead flies (one of which is here), but the returns have diminished with almost every show. Hirst may well think he is giving us what we deserve: an art of spectacle and the tokens of spectacular wealth. The show's last rooms are full of such things, among them a Carrara marble angel, whose exposed guts and skull are sculpted as tenderly as the feathers on her wings; a white-on-white spot painting whose edges are anointed with gold leaf; a pure white dove caught in flight in a limpid tank of formaldehyde.\n\nThe cloying ostentation of these rooms is surely deliberate, but does not make one want to linger. Lots of artists have made works with expensive materials but very few flaunt it the way Damien does. His later work might want to be an attack on the puritanism of a certain sort of highbrow taste, or it might be pandering to the vulgarity of super-rich collectors, or to the perversity of the art market and the place he has come to occupy in it. Maybe he wants it every way he can. Down in the darkened Turbine Hall, his diamond-encrusted platinum skull is displayed in a specially constructed black-box room. The theatricality of this is nauseating – or would be, if it weren't so silly and contrived.\n\nOthers have already weighed in with spite, gall and a fury quite out of proportion to the fact that Hirst is only an artist. There are some who look forward to his downfall. In 1991, reviewing In and Out of Love, I wrote that Hirst's work had enormous spirit and great originality, and that I was glad he was around. By 2009 I was writing that his recent paintings were \"momento mori for a reputation\" (the hapless paintings Hirst showed at the Wallace Collection that year have thankfully been passed over here). My problem with Hirst is not the money (Picasso made lots, and nobody cares), nor the vulgarity he has opted for, but his capitulation as an artist. He could have been so much better. It is an enormous disappointment.\n\n• This article was amended on 24 April 2012. References to Formica, which is a trademark, have been changed to laminate.",

The trend began with first-round pick Arik Armstead, a defensive tackle who wasn’t a full-time football player until his final season at Oregon because he also played basketball.\n\nEven in May, it appeared evident that none of the 49ers’ 10 picks would open the season as a starter.\n\nGiven that, this shouldn’t come as a surprise: Safety Jaquiski Tartt is the only rookie to play more than 21 percent of snaps this season, and he is logging significant playing time only because starter Antoine Bethea is on season-ending injured reserve.\n\nHere’s a rundown of the draft picks after nine games:\n\nDT Arik Armstead, first round\n\nDefensive snaps played: 21 percent (130 of 620)\n\nArmstead has been used as a situational player on passing downs and consistently has produced pressure with a strong bull-rush move. On 114 passing snaps, Armstead has collected a sack, three quarterback hits and 17 hurries, according to Pro Football Focus. Defensive coordinator Eric Mangini recently said Armstead has made notable strides after his early-season performance included some habits Mangini wasn’t “excited about.” There are reasons to be excited about Armstead, whose size (6-foot-7, 292 pounds) and agility should be on display more in the final seven regular-season games.\n\nS Jaquiski Tartt, second round\n\nDefensive snaps played: 34 percent (210 of 620)\n\nOne year removed from playing teams such as Concordia and Wofford, Tartt has made a rather seamless jump from small-college football to the NFL. The Samford alum replaced starter Bethea in the past two games and has flashed excellent range while providing several huge hits, including a wallop on Atlanta wide receiver Julio Jones. Tartt’s aggressiveness cost him in his first start against St. Louis. He sprinted up from the secondary to make plays and was out of position on a 71-yard touchdown run and a 66-yard scoring pass. Still, Mangini said Tartt’s fearlessness is an excellent trait and can be harnessed. In Mangini’s view, aggressiveness can’t be coached: (If) “they don’t bite when they’re puppies,” he said, “they don’t bite when they’re older.”\n\nLB Eli Harold, third round\n\nDefensive snaps played: 20 percent (122 of 620)\n\nGive this rookie some more time in the weight room and cafeteria. The release of Aldon Smith in training camp provided Harold with an opportunity to receive meaningful snaps, but he’s not quite ready to provide meaningful production. One reason: Harold, 6-3 and 247 pounds, is shrimp-sized for a 3-4 outside linebacker. Starters Ahmad Brooks (259) and Aaron Lynch (270) have more than 10 pounds on him, and Harold’s lack of strength makes him a one-dimensional speed-rusher. His lack of go-to moves explains his scant production: no sacks and five tackles.\n\nTE Blake Bell, fourth round\n\nOffensive snaps played: 13 percent (66 of 569)\n\nThe 49ers have traded three tight ends (Vernon Davis, Derek Carrier and Asante Cleveland) in the past three months, which has cleared a path for Bell to make an impact. Eventually. His scant playing time and production (three receptions, 17 yards) can be explained partly by his unique background. Bell, who was a quarterback at Oklahoma, didn’t switch to tight end until his final college season, when he had 16 receptions. He’s the No. 3 tight end behind Garrett Celek and Vance McDonald.\n\nRB Mike Davis, fourth round\n\nOffensive snaps played: 12 percent (66 of 569)\n\nIt has been a rough NFL introduction for Davis, who had surgery for a broken hand Nov. 3 and landed on injured reserve with the designation to return. Before his injury, Davis had produced a painful stat line: 25 carries, 24 yards. If he returns this season, he’ll have a chance to avoid a dubious distinction. Since 1960, only one running back has averaged less than a yard a carry with at least 25 carries in a season (Donnell Bennett, Chiefs, 2000). Davis (5-9, 217 pounds) hasn’t been assisted by a below-average offensive line, but he also hasn’t shown memorable traits. He doesn’t have great speed or make-defenders-miss ability.\n\nWR DeAndre Smelter, fourth round\n\nSmelter, who is on the non-football injury list, began practicing this week, but he’s unlikely to join the 53-man roster after he sustained a torn ACL last year. Baalke’s penchant for drafting players recovering from serious knee injuries hasn’t been successful. The list: defensive tackle Tank Carradine, running back Marcus Lattimore, guard Brandon Thomas, cornerback Keith Reaser and fullback Trey Millard. Even when he’s ready, Smelter will require patience. He played only baseball in his first two seasons at Georgia Tech.\n\nP Bradley Pinion, fifth round\n\nBy drafting Pinion, 21, and subsequently trading All-Pro Andy Lee, 33, the 49ers got younger and cheaper at the position. They’ve gotten what they paid for. Pinion ranks 24th in the NFL gross average (44.4) and 18th in net average (39.9). Lee ranks sixth in both categories. Pinion, the youngest player on the team, was the only punter drafted. This month, special-teams coach Thomas McGaughey said Pinion’s underwhelming rookie season can be attributed partly to problems performing under pressure: “A lot of kickers can kick the ball when nobody is out there,” McGaughey said. “… But when you put him in front of 100,000 people, it’s a little bit different, and the pressure is there.”\n\nG Ian Silberman, sixth round\n\nSilberman started the third preseason game, but has been inactive for eight of nine regular-season games.\n\nOT Trent Brown, seventh round\n\nOffensive snaps played: 2 percent (9 of 569)\n\nHe’s 6-8 and 355 pounds, and left tackle Joe Staley insists he hasn’t had a more titanic teammate. Brown is a project who started 11 of 23 games at Florida, but he has surprisingly nimble feet, and he made enough progress in practice to earn a nine-snap cameo at right tackle Nov. 8 in his NFL offensive debut. Starter Erik Pears isn’t a long-term answer, and Brown could compete for the 2016 starting spot if Anthony Davis doesn’t return to the team.\n\nTE Busta Anderson, seventh round\n\nAnderson is on injured reserve with an ankle injury he sustained in the preseason.\n\nEric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

        "instruction": "General Electric’s slogan for decades was, “We bring good things to life.”\n\nIt was never: “We put infernally hot things in mouths.”\n\nBut the industrial conglomerate, looking to add pep to its image as it overhauls its business and prepares to move to Boston, has teamed with a hot sauce company to produce a limited run of an intensely scorching mixture called 10³² K.\n\nThe purpose of the combustible condiment, named for the temperature in degrees Kelvin at which all matter breaks down, is to draw attention to GE’s advanced materials that can withstand very high temperatures. These are used in industrial products, such as jet engines and gas turbines, that form the backbone of chief executive Jeffrey R. Immelt’s plan to shift the company’s focus from its financial business and appliances.\n\nThe hot sauce, created by High River Sauces, has no connection to GE’s industrial strategy; it’s one of a series of offbeat marketing campaigns launched by the company in recent months.\n\n“It’s hard for people to understand what does hot really mean and why do you need a special material,” said Christine Furstoss, vice president for manufacturing and materials at GE, who oversees development of the company’s heat-resistant materials. She stopped by the Globe with a 5.4-ounce bottle of 10³² K so that staffers could sample the stuff in tiny doses.\n\nSo, how hot was it?\n\n“Essentially my insides were on fire,” said business reporter Jon Chesto.\n\nIn fact, the reporter’s insides, as with those of other testers, were in no danger.\n\nThe burning sensation is the body’s reaction to capsaicin, the active compound that makes chili peppers hot, according to Noah Chaimberg founder of The Heatonist, the Brooklyn hot sauce shop where a limited supply of the 10³² K sauce, priced at $20, sold out within two days last month.\n\nThe capsaicin binds to the same nerve receptors in your mouth that are the ones that pick up physical heat, “so your brain gets the signal that you’re actually being burned,” Chaimberg said.\n\n“The only actual danger that can come from peppers is from your body overreacting to the perceived threat,” he wrote in an e-mail. “This could include making your heart rate speed up, flooding your body with adrenaline, or even losing consciousness (very rare).”\n\nBut, he said, chili peppers are “very healthy,” and anyone can develop a tolerance to hot sauce over time by gradually increasing the “heat” of the sauce. This is measured on the Scoville scale, named for Wilbur Scoville, an American pharmacist who developed the system in 1912.\n\nChaimberg said the average jalapeño usually runs between 4,000 to 10,000 heat units on the scale. The GE sauce uses two of the hottest peppers in the world: The Carolina Reaperand the Trinidad Moruga Scorpion. The hottest ever single Reaper checked in at 2.2 million heat units, and the average reading is about 1.6 million, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe mean for Scorpion peppers is 1.2 million heat units, but some have measured more than 2 million, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nHow all of this relates to GE’s advanced materials is, apparently, in the packaging that enclosed Furstoss’s bottle: a slate-colored cylindrical container made with silicon carbide. (Bottles sold at The Heatonist came in the high-tech packaging, which Chaimberg acknowledged was “unnecessary, but cool to handle.”)\n\n“We use the same material treated a different way in things like aircraft engines,” Furstoss said. “The hotter you run the combustion of an aircraft engine, the more thrust you can get with less emissions.” Similarly, circuit boards made of silicon carbide can be smaller, because they don’t require fans for cooling.\n\nSo the analogy with hot sauce is neither complete nor perfect. Intended to show the effect of heat, the sauce is in fact harmless.\n\nFurstoss shrugged. “For me this is a great way for people to think about why do you care what’s hot, how do you think about materials, by trying hot sauce,” she said.\n\nThe hot sauce is part of a series of offbeat marketing ideas that GE has rolled out recently, as it seeks to appeal to a younger generation of engineers. They are certainly the target of TV ads that feature a geeky cool guy who tries to explain to friends and family that his new job at GE is to write code rather than build big industrial things.\n\nGE has also hosted sci-fi podcasts, issued GE-branded comic books. and sold a line of futuristic silver sneakers to celebrate GE’s contribution to the moon boots used by NASA astronauts. The sneakers were sold online on Thrillist, a retail site where most of the 1,000 bottles of 10³² K produced were sold.\n\nThere is no plan to produce any more, Furstoss said. “We are not getting into the hot sauce business.”",

        "instruction": "This post is in partnership with Entrepreneur. The article below was originally published at Entrepreneur.com.\n\nNow that December has arrived, it’s time to make some smart moves to set up your company for an even better next year.\n\nHere’s my seven-point checklist for entrepreneurs at the year’s end:\n\nCan your company accommodate the growth forecast for next year? Review your projections for next year and be sure to plan appropriately in each area of the budget.\n\nDo you have the sales staff to meet the revenue goals? Have you adequate office space to accommodate the hires? How will an increased number of clients strain customer service? Will an increased amount of traffic affect Internet costs?.\n\nIf you haven’t been doing your books monthly and paying taxes or setting aside money, you’re on the naughty list. Perhaps you haven’t spent enough time reviewing the numbers and the company’s performance.\n\nBe sure to examine the financial reports carefully and compare the changes from years past. Note if any results are off and make a plan to push the numbers in the right direction next year.\n\nYou might be thinking about your business all the time, but it’s easy to not communicate your thoughts with staff. You might have changed the company’s direction or added services without bringing everyone to the table.\n\nThe end of the year is a great time to reflect on the company’s performance, talk about challenges and accomplishments and plan for the year ahead. Have a meeting before your holiday party so that the festivities don’t have to involve talking business.\n\nBig expenses that hold the promise of significant growth dominate your thoughts. Look at any big-ticket items for next year and figure out if you can pay them off for a guaranteed savings.\n\nMonthly software services, for example, often grant 20 percent off to those who pay a year in advance. Likewise a landlord might offer a 10 percent discount if rent is furnished for the entire year. Spot these savings and make an investment now. You’ll save money over the long haul.\n\nWhen you review the year, be aware of how staffers have used existing systems. Probably members of your team live and die by certain software programs but use others infrequently. Sometimes if employees aren’t using a certain software program, a system or a piece of equipment, they don’t understand it.\n\nOther times, the use case isn’t real and your team just doesn’t need the software. Consider eliminating any unused systems next year.\n\nThe best goals are framed to be actionable. But it’s easy to forget this when setting longer-term objectives.\n\nWell, it might be nice to say you’ve adopted a goal to increase sales 40 percent. But how? Know that adopting any goal requires a change in behavior. So what are you and your staff about to do differently? Are you shifting your approach to focus on products that sold well this year?\n\nWill the company do more marketing? What will you and your staff do differently next year that will effect enough positive change to reach your goals? Create a specific action plan and arrive at a consensus and an understanding of the new behaviors required.\n\nArrange for charitable giving for the selfish reasons of a tax write-off or good publicity. Or do so unselfishly because you’re an awesome person. But take time to contribute something before the year’s end.\n\nConsider matching employee gifts to a charity that’s engaged in a similar area as your company is. Making a donation of your time or money helps build a sense of purpose for your staff and your company.\n\nHow Giving Could Become Your Default Weapon of Choice\n\n7 Simple Steps to Take for a Successful 2015\n\nBalance Fun and Productivity at the Year’s End",

But you would never know it from the prices at the pump.\n\nThe national average price of gasoline is $3.69 per gallon and is forecast to creep higher, possibly approaching $4 by May.\n\n‘‘I just don’t get it,’’ said Steve Laffoon, a mental health worker, who paid $3.59 per gallon in St. Louis.\n\nUS oil output rose 14 percent to 6.5 million barrels per day last year — a record increase. And by 2020, the nation is forecast to overtake Saudi Arabia as the world’s largest crude oil producer. At the same time, US gasoline demand has fallen to 8.7 million barrels a day, its lowest level since 2001, as people switch to more fuel-efficient cars.\n\nSo is the high price of gas a sign markets are not working properly?\n\nNot at all, experts say. The law of supply and demand is working, just not how US drivers would want.\n\nUS drivers are competing with drivers globally for every gallon. As the developing economies of Asia and Latin America expand, their consumption rises, which puts pressure on fuel supplies and prices everywhere else.\n\nThe United States still consumes more oil than any other country, but demand is weak and imports are falling. That leaves China, which overtook the United States late last year as the world’s largest oil importer, as the single biggest influence on global demand for fuels. China’s consumption has risen 28 percent in five years, to 10.2 million barrels per day last year.\n\n‘‘There’s an 800-pound gorilla in the picture now: the Chinese economy,’’ said Patrick DeHaan, chief petroleum analyst at GasBuddy.com.\n\nUS refiners are free to sell gas to the highest bidder around the world. In 2011, the United States became a net exporter of fuels for the first time in 60 years. Mexico and Canada are the two biggest destinations for US fuels, followed by Brazil and the Netherlands.\n\nTwo other factors are making gasoline expensive:\n\n■ High oil prices. Brent crude, a benchmark used to set the price of oil for many US refiners, is $108 per barrel. It has not been below $100 per barrel since July. On average, the price of crude is responsible for two-thirds of the price of gasoline, according to the Energy Department.\n\n■ Refinery shutdowns. Refineries temporarily close in the winter, when driving declines, to perform annual maintenance. That lowers gas inventories and sends prices higher nearly every year in the late winter and spring.\n\nRising gasoline prices act as a drag on the economy because they leave less money in drivers’ wallets to for them spend on other things. But because average prices have remained in a consistent range — between $3 and $4 per gallon since the end of 2010 — economists say their effect on growth has been minimal.\n\nFor the year, prices are forecast to average $3.55 per gallon, slightly lower than last year’s record average of $3.63.\n\nThe peak for 2013, likely to come this spring, is expected to fall slightly short of last year’s peak of $3.94.",

        "instruction": "One evening in December 1989, John Gotti had a conversation with his acting underboss, Frank Locascio, about murdering a troublesome underling in the Gambino crime family who had failed to show up to a meeting.\n\n“Louie DiBono,” Mr. Gotti said. “You know why he’s dying? He’s gonna die because he refused to come in when I called. He didn’t do nothing else wrong.”\n\nMr. Locascio predicted Mr. DiBono would be bringing Mr. Gotti a large sum of cash the next day. “But I wouldn’t take nothing,” the crime boss answered, affirming in colorful language that Mr. DiBono’s days were numbered.\n\nThat taped conversation, along with the testimony of the family’s third-in-command, Salvatore (Sammy the Bull) Gravano, was enough to convict Mr. Locascio of conspiring to murder Mr. DiBono, who met his end violently in a parking garage 10 months later. Mr. Locascio received a life sentence for murder and racketeering.\n\nFor years, Mr. Locascio, who is 83, has insisted that he tried to talk Mr. Gotti out of killing Mr. DiBono. He claims he tried to broker a deal that Mr. DiBono would pay Mr. Gotti $50,000 to make peace.\n\nAnd he contends the same audiotapes used to convict him, if enhanced with modern digital techniques, would prove he is right. Many of his words are inaudible during the conversation with Mr. Gotti, swallowed up in music and background noise.\n\nHaving exhausted his other avenues of appeal, Mr. Locascio is now locked in a legal battle with the federal government over access to two of the tapes, which were sealed by Judge I. Leo Glasser in 1998. He has filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit in Washington seeking to force the Federal Bureau of Investigation to hand over the tapes so his audio expert may analyze them with digital tools.\n\nHe faces more than legal obstacles. Justice Department lawyers said in February that the original seven inch reel-to-reel recordings made by F.B.I. agents had been damaged beyond repair when Hurricane Sandy flooded the agency’s storage facility in New Jersey. In court papers, the Justice Department has also said officials searched the 151 boxes of records from the trial and could not find copies of the two tapes Mr. Locascio is seeking.\n\nEven if undamaged copies of the recordings are located, the Justice Department contends it does not have to release them under the FOIA, according to court papers. Though the tapes were played in court and the transcripts have been published in a book, they are now under seal and are no longer in the public domain, the government argued in court filings.\n\nComplicating matters, F.B.I. officials in Washington handed over a redacted copy of one of the tapes on a compact disc in late March, only to ask for it back a few days later, saying they had made a mistake. On Monday, prosecutors went into Federal District Court in Brooklyn and asked Judge Glasser to order Mr. Locascio’s lawyers to return the CD.\n\nThe suit is the latest in a long series of unsuccessful attempts by Mr. Locascio’s lawyers to get a new trial. Judge Glasser and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit have repeatedly upheld his conviction — five times.\n\nIn 2011, Judge Glasser also rejected Mr. Locascio’s request to unseal the tapes, noting that his lawyers were given copies of the original recordings at trial. The judge said he had ruled against Mr. Locascio at trial when he tried to call on an audio expert to interpret the tapes for the jury. That ruling still stood, he wrote.\n\n“This is a thinly disguised effort to re-litigate a ruling made during the trial upon which Locascio and his counsel can only be described as fixated,” he wrote.\n\nMr. Locascio’s lawyer, Ruth M. Liebesman, said Mr. Locascio should be able to analyze the original tapes with modern audio techniques, just as other defendants have been allowed to re-examine old DNA evidence with advanced technology. “Why shouldn’t we be able to do that with tapes as well?” she said.\n\nThe recordings were made with a bug placed in an older woman’s apartment above the Ravenite Social Club on Mulberry Street in Little Italy in Manhattan, where Mr. Gotti held court. The jury never heard the original reel-to-reel recordings. Copies were made on cassettes, and the originals were put back in the F.B.I.’s safe at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, an agent, George Gabriel, testified.\n\nThe agent also testified the tapes had not been enhanced or altered before the jury heard them, a contention Mr. Locascio’s audio expert disputes.\n\nEven if Mr. Locascio obtains the original tapes and can tease out a clearer recording of his words by digitally filtering out distortion and background noise, he is unlikely to persuade the courts to grant him a new trial. For starters, Mr. Gravano testified that no murders were committed without the agreement of both Mr. Gotti and Mr. Locascio.\n\nThe jury also seemed to be persuaded by an F.B.I. agent’s testimony that the December 1989 conversation between Mr. Gotti and Mr. Locascio showed the decision to kill Mr. DiBono had already been made, and no payment he might make would change the plan. Judge Glasser highlighted this point in a 2005 opinion denying Mr. Locascio a new trial.\n\nIn a 2011 affidavit supporting his request to unseal the tapes, Mr. Locascio remembered things differently. “It is my clear recollection that, after telling Gotti that ‘I predict that he’s going to bring you fifty,’ I told Gotti, in sum and substance, to take the money and forget about his anger with DiBono,” he said, adding: “I had nothing to do with the DiBono’s murder.”\n\nFor Mr. Locascio, time is growing short. Had he been convicted only of racketeering, the maximum sentence would have been 20 years and he would now be free. But the murder conviction means he will die in prison, just as John Gotti did in 2002.\n\nMr. Locascio is incarcerated in a prison hospital, the Federal Medical Center Devens in Ayer, Mass. To pay legal bills, his family has sold an upstate horse farm he owned. He uses a wheelchair, has emphysema and cannot stand on his own. Most days, Mr. Locascio maintains an old street tough’s optimism about his chances of release, despite the long odds, his nephew, also named Frank Locascio, said. Other days are darker.\n\n“I only heard him down in one visit,” his nephew said. “He was saying ‘I’m the little fish in the fish tank and the water’s evaporating.’”",

But that doesn’t mean there isn’t a chance of stormy weather, and if it does arrive, its source may very well be the manufacturing sector.\n\nU.S. manufacturers are struggling mightily, according to the latest reading of national manufacturing data by the Institute for Supply Management. The ISM index sees manufacturing activity contracting for the first time since December of 2012, with 13 of the 18 manufacturing industries tracked by the index seen to be contracting.\n\nMichael Montgomery, an economist with IHS Global insight, argues that weakness here in the U.S. is related to economic struggles abroad. “The manufacturing sector is suffering from a bad case of the blahs worldwide,” he writes Tuesday in a note to clients. He attribues this weakness to an “anemic global demand for goods” in combination with the drag of a strong dollar on exporters here at home.\n\nTaking a step back, it shouldn’t surprise us that manufacturing is looking weak right now. China is now reaping the fruits of years of over investment in manufacturing capacity, and the sharp slowdown in growth has severely depressed global commodity prices. At the same time, rising inequality and elevated unemployment in the wealthy world has led to slow wage growth and tepid demand for consumer goods. The global manufacturing sector is where all the flaws of the global economy are most salient.\n\nBut Americans—at least those who don’t rely on manufacturing for their income—can take comfort in the fact that the vast majority of U.S. economic activity takes place in the services sector.\n\nAs you can see from the above chart, the performances of the services and manufacturing sector have diverged of late. The good news is that the services sector is about five-and-a-half times bigger in the United States that the manufacturing sector. Montgomery expects the weakness in manufacturing to continue well into 2016, but the fact that services are so much more important to the overall health of the U.S. economy means that he and other economists are sticking with an overall sunny economic forecast for the near future.",

        "instruction": "“American Heiress,” Jeffrey Toobin’s new book about Patty Hearst, is a clever companion piece to “The Run of His Life” (1996), his book about the O. J. Simpson case. Mr. Toobin has used the same winning formula of delving deeply into an American crime story that had tremendous notoriety in its day and retelling it with new resonance.\n\nMs. Hearst’s tale is much more bizarre than Mr. Simpson’s. And much less of it has to do with legal proceedings, Mr. Toobin’s specialty. But in an age of terrorism, the chronicle of how a sedate heiress named Patricia morphed into a gun-toting, invective-spouting revolutionary calling herself Tania holds a definite fascination.\n\nMs. Hearst did not cooperate with this account. And she would hate it if she read it. Nor would she appreciate that this book contradicts her memoir, “Every Secret Thing,” or that Mr. Toobin purports to know what she was really thinking, on the basis of voluminous but incomplete evidence. The witnesses to Ms. Hearst’s behavior during her years underground certainly made a lot of observations about her. But the crucial people — those who may or may not have brainwashed her — knew her for only three months before they died.\n\nIt’s not that “American Heiress” is meanspirited. It’s just that Mr. Toobin — who read her love letters, reviewed material available to investigators and bought an extensive set of files assembled by one her revolutionary comrades — wants to understand exactly what happened to Ms. Hearst despite her clearly dishonest accounts after the fact, including in court. So this book is adversarial by definition. It credits its subject with a strength and resilience that would not have prevailed had she not also been a determined liar.\n\nOne of the few unassailable facts is that Ms. Hearst was kidnapped and thrown into a car trunk at 9:17 p.m. on Feb. 4, 1974, by people calling themselves the Symbionese Liberation Army. She had been at home with her fiancé, Steven Weed, whose response to the attackers was to exclaim, “Take anything you want!” They did.\n\nAmazingly, almost every detail from this point on remains open to interpretation. How badly was the kidnapping victim treated? It’s true she was confined to a walk-in closet that locked from the outside and that she went through extreme sensory deprivation. But would this become the basis for brainwashing?\n\nOr were her captors, about whom Mr. Toobin has a lot of background information, partly stalling as they figured out what to do with her? Of Donald DeFreeze, the leader who became briefly ubiquitous as Cinque, the Symbionese Liberation Army’s general field marshal, and whose planning skills were hugely problematic, Mr. Toobin writes: “DeFreeze was almost the opposite of a master criminal; he was most inventive in finding ways to get caught.”\n\nMr. Toobin’s book looks closely at the group members’ goals, only to find that, collectively, they couldn’t agree on any. Posturing and making demands were what they did best. Yet Mr. Toobin maintains that by the time the captors began to demand that the Hearst family sponsor a food giveaway in California, Ms. Hearst was in sync with her captors’ attitudes. She had a television in the closet, and seeing her parents make public statements annoyed her; in a statement of her own, she even complained about her mother’s mournful black clothes.\n\nMs. Hearst’s rhetoric as Tania was real, Mr. Toobin says. And so was her eagerness to pose for the photo that he calls a Mona Lisa for the 1970s: pinup Patty, expressionless, wearing a beret and brandishing an automatic weapon in front of the group’s seven-headed cobra logo.\n\nHow could someone from the Hearsts’ cosseted world change so quickly? Mr. Toobin’s account makes the transformation understandable. For one thing, he presents Ms. Hearst’s life as Mr. Weed’s fiancée as dreary (according to the book, the two never spoke again after the kidnapping) and her new life as dramatic and romantic by comparison. For another, revolutionary spouting off and instant fame had their allure. In any case, it did not have to stand the test of time. A little more than three months after the kidnapping, the captors to whom she was closest died in a Los Angeles shootout that turned their hide-out into an inferno.\n\nShe stayed on the run, avoiding arrest until Sept. 18, 1975, by which time she had racked up serious potential weapons and bank robbery charges. Mr. Toobin writes that she thought of these events as mischief and fund-raising, even though one robbery involved a felony murder.\n\nAnd then the unimaginable happened — again. “In her first days in jail, she was writing to her lover that ‘there will be a revolution in Amerikkka and we’ll be helping to make it,’” Mr. Toobin writes. “Less than a month later, she was asking her sister Anne for makeup: ‘I’ll tell you what I want — liner, mascara, lip gloss.’” As Mr. Toobin sees it, Patty — now Patricia again — was always an adroit opportunist, never a deep thinker, and remained an artful pragmatist under any circumstances.\n\n“As she weighed her future, Patricia chose between a world where people went skiing in the Alps and one where they ate horse meat and slept in crawl spaces,” he writes. She seems to have seen that as an easy call.\n\nThe last part of this book covers what was then called “the trial of the century.” And, fittingly, F. Lee Bailey was a prime player. Mr. Toobin writes so well about him that it’s tempting to imagine his Bailey biography, although Mr. Bailey has probably written enough about himself already. According to the epilogue here, he has never regained his right to practice law after a 2001 disbarment and at some point in 2016 “was doing business as a ‘legal consultant’ in a single room above a beauty salon in a resort town in Maine.”\n\nThe book’s legal pièce de résistance is how Mr. Bailey bungled Ms. Hearst’s defense in charges of robbing the Hibernia Bank in San Francisco, the first of several crimes for which she was accused. For all his gaffes, though, Mr. Bailey saved her from a murder trial. She wound up serving minimal prison time and receiving special treatment from two presidents: commutation of sentence from Jimmy Carter and a pardon from Bill Clinton. Note the “Heiress” in the title.\n\nMr. Toobin points out that American prisons are full of people who are led astray and wind up committing criminal acts. They have no chance at one act of clemency, let alone two.\n\nThe Wild Saga of the Kidnapping, Crimes and Trial of Patty Hearst\n\nA version of this review appears in print on July 27, 2016, on page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Kidnapped: A Rich Girl Radicalized in the 1970s.

This represents a nice return for the venture capital firms that pumped nearly $35 million into Paydiant over the past four years, given that the post-money valuation on its Series B and Series C rounds were $55 million and $117 million, respectively.\n\nFor PayPal, which is in the process of spinning off from eBay EBAY , this move makes total sense. The company has struggled to create mobile payment solutions for physical retailers and banks, at the same time that later-arriving rivals like Apple AAPL and Google GOOG have gained traction. The better question, however, is why Paydiant would sell out just as its industry is beginning to garner mainstream attention.\n\nHere is the explanation from Jim Moran, a venture capitalist whose firm, North Bridge, originally funded and incubated Paydiant:\n\n“The reality is that mobile payments is still a zero billion dollar industry. While we had very big contracts with some very big merchants, the actual dollar values and volumes were just kicking in. And then you have what Apple is doing, which shined a big light on what we were doing but it caused a lot of boards to stutter-step on mobile payments. Apple’s solution is very simple and requires NFC-capable point-of-sale systems which aren’t very common yet, but they do have hundreds of millions of loyal customers and great phone. Plus, they’re Apple and they could buy a small country.\n\nSo we mapped the capital requirements against time and projected volume — which equates the the revenue register ringing for us — and we felt the partnership with PayPal made a lot of sense. Particularly since its incoming CEO, Dan Schulman, knew us from his time at American Express AMEX and that our platform is industrial strength. He wants this to become a very big division of PayPal, and the [Paydiant] team was all on board… When a team tells you it’s time, it’s not my place to say it isn’t.”\n\nIn addition to North Bridge, Paydiant backers included General Catalyst, Stage 1 Ventures, Sands Capital Ventures and West Capital Management.\n\nSign up for Term Sheet, our daily newsletter on deals and deal-makers.",

        "instruction": "The roads were calm and uncluttered, minutes passed before another vehicle appeared. On the horizon the Sierra Nevada rolled along in the sunlight, still snow-capped and blue-hued in places. Outside the car was the countryside of rural Andalucía, with its olive and almond groves, and spaghetti western-like terrain. I drove the narrow, cobbled roads into Alhama de Granada’s main square, Plaza Constitucion, and parked with ease, ready to explore this small hill town with its Moorish quarter, the Iglesia del Carmen and dramatic views of Los Tajos (the gorge).\n\nThe joys of this out-of-season break extended beyond the uncongested roads. The temperature was a pleasant 20C, the sunshine was constant, other tourists were few and the pace of life had shifted down a couple of gears. Yet, I had not driven to the back of beyond to get here: around 45 minutes’ drive in a hire car from Málaga airport had taken me to my base, the town of Archidona. The capital of Málaga province during Moorish rule, it’s now a regular working town with a population of around 9,000 and a reassuringly light dash of tourism.\n\nI checked in at Almohalla 51, a five-bedroom boutique guesthouse – comprised of two renovated townhouses – run by David Matthews and Myles Rainford. The whitewashed walls, exposed beams and stone-tiled floors make for a calming retreat. The house is on several levels and has a higgledy-piggeldy feel, with nooks to read in. There is also a shaded patio, a terrace to soak up the sun and a plunge pool.\n\nI preferred to keep cosy by the woodburner – the daytime was mild but after sundown there was a chill. My fireside reading included Washington Irving’s Tales of the Alhambra; first published in 1832, the book’s essays and short fiction detail the American writer’s journey through this part of Spain, and helped inspire David and Myles’s Andalucía: the Roads Less Travelled package. The four-night, off-season itinerary explores some of Andalucía’s lesser-known small towns, which are often as historic, beautiful and architecturally interesting as the region’s big hitters: Seville, Granada, Córdoba and Ronda. The routes include driving instructions, sights, and tips on where to eat. None were much more than an hour or so from Archidona and easy to explore on the empty roads.\n\nThe highlight was Setenil de las Bodegas, a river-gorge town dominated by a hilltop church and a Moorish fort. What stole the show, though, were the houses, shops and bars built into the overhanging rocks of the Cuevas del Sol and Cuevas de la Sombra, either side of the Rio Trejo. At times the labyrinthine streets made Setenil feel like an MC Escher artwork, but losing my way here was an enjoyable challenge not an ordeal, the legwork leading me to Restaurante Palmero and the chance to savour migas. I’d never thought a dish of breadcrumbs would make such an impact but these – slowly fried over a fire with garlic, chorizo and black pudding – were a robust and flavoursome experience.\n\nAntequera, about 25km west of Archidona, offered an Alcazar next to a baroque church (Real Colegiata de Santa María La Mayor) and beside them Roman ruins. In the spring sunshine the view over the town led the eye to dolmens (prehistoric burial grounds with Unesco heritage status pending) and the majestic La Peña de los Enamorados (Lover’s Rock).\n\nIn Osuna, I explored ornate former duke’s palaces on Calle San Pedro, its cathedral and 16th-century university building. But I could also have searched out its bullring, monastery or Plaza Mayor. In fact, had I not chosen Osuna, the routes from Almohalla 51 could have taken me to Estepa, Priego de Córdoba, Olvera or Zuheros. What I discovered was that there was always another hospitable town to visit.\n\nI came to see Archidona as a jumping-off point but made sure I still wandered its winding, occasionally steep streets. I found the calm of Plaza de la Iglesia de Santa Ana and the focal point of Plaza Ochavada, the town’s “octagonal” baroque square. Around here were bars and restaurants, among them the traditional Bar Central, Bar Picasso with its Italian twist, and the contemporary (and remarkable) Restaurante Arxiduna – built into caves that form part of the plaza. Dishes such as foie mille-feuille (€14), pork shoulder crunch (€12) and a distinctive take on a New York cheesecake (€4.50) were simply breathtaking in their flavour, sense of fun and eye-catching presentation.\n\nNot every traveller is looking for solitude and tradition - for some there is a need for hubbub and activity. I was aware of that on the occasions I sat in uncrowded cafes, strolled along empty ramparts or chatted to locals. But, as I watched the sunset from the summit of Sierra de Gracia – a brief hike from Archidona – I knew this affordable out-of-season adventure had delivered far more than I had expected and reinforced the idea of how small can often be so beautiful.\n\n• Accommodation was provided by Almohalla 51, which offers Andalucia: the Roads Less Travelled from €300 (£233) in a standard room and €350 (£272) in a superior room. The package includes four nights’ B&B, self-guided itineraries and a copy of Washington Irving’s book Tales of the Alhambra. Rhino Car Hire offers car rental from Málaga airport from £25 a week\n\nDreamy castles and ducal palaces. Forests of cork oak grazed by wild boar. Fragrant meadows brilliant with salvia and silene. It’s a wonder the Alentejo, in southern Portugal, isn’t as crowded as Tuscany. Perhaps it’s because temperatures - away from the coast - soar to a 40C in summer.\n\nWhich is why I’ve chosen spring, when it’s pleasantly warm in the village of Marvão on the Spanish border. From Lisbon, I drove here in just under two hours via an empty motorway then a winding mountain road into the Serra de Estrela hills, which cut through little whitewashed villages and terraces of vineyards green with young leaves. I stopped at the Roman ruins of Ammaia: a shamble of rubble that was once a great trading town, and took a detour to the Menhir da Meada, a seven-metre-high digit of weather-worn neolithic stone towering over a lonely landscape of butterfly-filled fields.\n\nThen I saw Marvão and it looked spectacular, even from a distance: a jagged crenulation of church towers and fortified walls silhouetted against a deep yellow afternoon sun.\n\nBeyond the bastions, Marvão is a scatter of sugar-white houses, cut by half a dozen mule-cart wide streets and ringed with rugged walls put up by the Moors nearly 1,000 years ago. The ridgetop where it sits ripples into low hills that run to the horizon, where the setting sun oozes orange, gilding the whitewash of the village bell-towers. In the chilling air I descended to the village, footfalls echoing off the stone walls, and to Pousada de Marvão, the town’s only hotel, for port by a crackling fire and a dinner of ensopado de borrego (lamb hotpot).• Sunvil has three nights at Pousada de Marvão B&B from £510pp including flights and car hireAlex Robinson\n\nThe way Parisians talk about it, Corsica is the place to come to in summer. July heralds the electronic music festival Calvi on the Rocks, while August empties the city of its locals and dumps them on Mediterranean beaches. My partner and I had always longed to experience the island’s dramatic landscape, a juxtaposition of sea and mountains, but peak-season flights were too expensive. Luckily, Corsican friends from Calvi and the surrounding Balagne region let us in on a secret: the year-round temperate climate makes the area great for off-season sunshine.\n\nWe flew in early October, with Calvi as our base. Many of its businesses are open year-round and the town is all the more delicious without the crowds. This is especially true of the citadel, Calvi’s pièce de résistance: a fortified labyrinth of cobblestone streets with impressive views of the city and the sea.\n\nExploring the rest of Balagne in our rental car, we discovered the Village d’Occi, a ghost town built in the middle ages and abandoned in the early 19th century, set against a panoramic backdrop. We continued up the coast to L’Île Rousse, known for its port, quaint streets and views of the big blue from its lighthouse. I was envious of the people swimming off the glistening shoreline, but my partner preferred to venture into the mountainous inland where villages perched in the clouds are as striking at a distance as they are up close. We spent our remaining days roaming from artist studios to vineyards to olive oil mills. Most of these are open all year, as Corsican culture does not ebb with the tourists.The only letdown was our Airbnb; when we return – and we’re definitely returning – I’m going to try the Hostellerie de l’Abbaye, a centrally located four-star hotel that has doubles from €120.Rozena Crossman\n\nHaving escaped the crowds of tourists in nearby Perugia, arriving in Gubbio, Umbria’s oldest town, brings a sense of discovery and achievement. But while it remains largely off foreigners’ radar, Italians flock to Gubbio during the country’s insufferably hot summers.\n\nThe cooler spring months are undoubtedly the best time to visit, when the lush countryside is at its most beautiful and Gubbio hosts its two most important events. The highlight comes on 15 May, when men charge through town bearing three huge wooden structures topped with statues of saints on the Ceri run, as a crowd lining the route roars them on. Another unmissable day comes on the last Sunday in May, when the town’s Crossbow Festival sees locals compete in the main square. Expect period dress and ceremonial flag-waving, too.\n\nWe headed to the 15th-century Ducal Palace, whose wooden study was deemed so exceptional it was shipped off to New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art. Thankfully, the replica produced by the town’s artisans is equally impressive. Nearby stands the Civic Museum, where we sought out the bronze Eugubine Tablets, written between the third and first centuries BC in the local language. This grand palace also affords views across to Gubbio’s ancient theatre, a sign of the importance of the town to Rome.\n\nA springtime trip to Gubbio wouldn’t be complete without a lengthy lunch along one of its narrow streets, and so we grabbed an outdoor table at Taverna del Lupo for its truffle-infused dishes. A hearty plate of pasta can be walked off by climbing the mountainside (or taking the cable car if you’ve over-indulged) - up to the Basilica of Sant’Ubaldo, where the Ceri structures are kept safe.

Her husband actually is a large lump of rock.\n\nRelated: Tracey Emin: soundtrack of my life\n\nAs her latest exhibition I Cried Because I Love You opens in Hong Kong, the woman whose life is her art has revealed that last summer she married a venerable stone that stands in her garden in France. “Somewhere on a hill facing the sea, there is a very beautiful ancient stone, and it’s not going anywhere,” she has said. “It will be there, waiting for me.” In another interview she has called it “‘an anchor, something I can identify with”. She wore her father’s funeral shroud as a wedding dress. As Lou Reed says: “And no kinds of love / are better than others.”\n\nThe ancient Roman poet Ovid says much the same thing at greater length in his Metamorphoses, the great poetic telling of myths in which a fleeing lover turns into a laurel tree, a young man adores his own reflection, and a woman called Echo who pines for him vanishes, leaving only her voice resonating in the olive groves. Love is strange, and Emin’s marriage is an exploration of its spiritual dimension.\n\nShe told the Art Newspaper she has been reading the letters of Pope John Paul II. The late Polish pope’s letters to the philosopher Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka were revealed by the BBC in February to show an intense, long-term, apparently celibate relationship between one of the most revered modern popes and a fellow intellectual. In other words Emin has been thinking about relationships that transcend the carnal – about love that goes beyond lust.\n\nPope John Paul II’s spiritual love affair was in a religious tradition that goes back to the Renaissance. It resembles the passionate friendship between the Catholic genius Michelangelo and the poet Vittoria Colonna in 16th-century Rome. Both were devout, and Michelangelo was gay, but they exchanged long and absorbing letters in their old age that see love as a spiritual journey.\n\nMichelangelo and Tracey Emin share a spiritual understanding of love, it seems. Many artists (Picasso leaps to mind) are ecstatically carnal. Others are fascinated by invisible dimensions of experience that go beyond the body. Michelangelo sculpted the human body more powerfully than any other artist, yet earthly gratification was never his theme. His heroic, struggling, superhuman nudes are physical expressions of the soul itself.\n\nRelated: Tracey Emin is still the real thing – and that's why we love her\n\nTracey Emin too is an artist of the inner life, not the outer body. This may seem surprising since her art is so pungently located in a material world of unmade beds and, more recently, drawings and paintings of her own naked body. But consider her early work Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995. Its title sounds like a sexual boast but the 102 people she listed, including her gran, were not all sexual partners – and the form of the work, a small tent, speaks not of sensuality but intimacy. It is a record of emotional connections, not sexual conquests. Her bed, too, is an emotional image, a monument to spiritual pain and solitude; a kind of martyr’s relic. In her more recent art, in a time of her life she describes as celibate, Emin is still more preoccupied with the soul, the invisible self – and the kind of love that lets the spirit soar.\n\nMichelangelo never actually married a rock, but he did have a vivid relationship with his favourite sculptural material: stone. In one of his letters he claims that stones themselves cry out at political oppression. In his great unfinished sculptures of slaves, human forms struggle to emerge from raw stone like souls trying to be born from the chrysalis of carnality into the life of the spirit.\n\nMichelangelo had some funny ideas and so does Tracey Emin. That is because they are truly poetic artists.",

Now that the lawyer is dead, his son is said to be offering the documents to collectors for $500,000 each, on the condition that the collectors won't show them to anyone for seven years.\n\nBut Hersh reportedly has convinced the Kennedy lawyer's son to show him the contracts.\n\nAmong those rumored to have made money pacts with the Kennedys:\n\nJudith Campbell Exner, reputed lover of JFK and mobster Sam Giancana, and Inga Arvad Fejos, the Danish reporter who romanced JFK in his Navy days.\n\nWorking on the project for more than two years, Hersh is said to have unzipped the lips of previously mum Kennedy administration officials.\n\nAs for the question of who killed JFK, word is Hersh thinks Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.\n\nHersh wouldn't discuss the book: \"I've got nothing to gain by talking about it.\"\n\nJulia Roberts and Lyle Lovett seem to be getting along better than ever lately. When Roberts recently organized a surprise birthday party for her sister, Lisa, what was most surprising was who she got to deliver the singing telegram. Lovett was seen tiptoeing into a private room at Flowers, the au courant restaurant in Chelsea, where the star had gathered family and friends. Lovett performed one of his own songs, and hung out next to his not-so-estranged wife for the rest of the night. . . .\n\nSharon Stone recently sent flowers to her boyfriend, Jim Connelly.

Allred told us, \"She's seeking child custody, temporary child support, spousal support and standard restraining orders.\" Allred refused to comment as to why those orders were needed. Trial is set for Jan. 16. . . .\n\nAnd David Carradine has left his wife, Gail.\n\n\"We're a better romantic couple when we're on the road,\" Carradine wrote in his surprisingly eloquent autobiography, \"Endless Highway.\" \"We take over a hotel, or maybe a whole country, and cut a wide swath. It's a stormy marriage, with moments of great joy and beauty and moments of anger and sadness.\"\n\nA source says Carradine was unhappy with his wife's lifestyle.\n\nComic Steve Harvey isn't laughing this week. The Def Comedy Jam host and former \"Me and the Boys\" star stands accused of making some pretty unfunny threats to his ex-manager, Chris DiPetta.\n\nDiPetta claims Harvey told him, \"I should f---ing kill you . . . If you pursue this thing, you don't know what will happen . . . Don't make me do what I have to do . . . I've got friends in Cleveland that will take you out.\"\n\nThe idea of Cleveland hit men may seem funny to some, but not to DiPetta. He's suing the standup for $31 million for intentional infliction of emotional distress and other charges.\n\nHarvey vigorously denies the charges, his lawyer Bruce Bolkin told us. \"[DiPetta] was fired as Steve Harvey's manager in February, and this is obviously his way of trying to get back at Steve.\"\n\nWesley Snipes' mother, Marion, called the hospital room of torched token booth clerk Harry Kaufman to offer condolences. Kaufman's wife, Stella, had requested that Snipes who stars in \"The Money Train,\" the film cops believe inspired the attack call her. No word on whether the star has called. . . .\n\n\"Star Trek\" captain Patrick Stewart, at the Water Club, confessing he doesn't know beans about astronomy: \"I wouldn't know a quasar from a quark if it jumped into bed with me.\" . . .\n\nChick flickmakers should put on their table-hopping shoes.

        "instruction": "A few weeks ago, a movie lover of my distant online acquaintance posted a blog entry titled “Keep your laughter off of my melodrama,” about the disconcerting experience of watching one of Douglas Sirk’s 1950s films with an ironic 21st-century audience. In short, a work of crazy but poignant emotional intensity was treated as a “mere” camp classic and hooted at accordingly. Her article may be useful reading before heading off to see Sirk’s 1959 masterpiece, “Imitation of Life,” in a freshly restored print at the Brattle, where it runs from Friday through Monday. Which, by the way, you should do.\n\nFor the uninitiated: Sirk, born Hans Detlef Sierck, was a German stage and film director who came to Hollywood in the 1930s and, toward the end of his career, specialized in opulent Technicolor melodramas of the kind proper-thinking moviegoers sniff at as “women’s weepies.” Movies like “Imitation,” “Magnificent Obsession” (1954), “All That Heaven Allows” (1955), and, my personal favorite, “Written on the Wind” (1956), were hugely popular commercial hits, which is in part why they were scorned by critics and other tastemakers of the era.\n\nBut Sirk was rediscovered in the 1970s. Film academics wrote long treatises (“Distanciation and Douglas Sirk”) and filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder remade “All That Heaven Allows” as “Ali: Fear Eats the Soul” (1974) — which, in turn, paved the way for Todd Haynes’s 2002 homage, “Far From Heaven.” A new generation of moviegoers found themselves enraptured and enriched by the social and psychological complexities Sirk could weave into his big-budget confections.\n\n“Imitation of Life” is a perfect case in point. Freely adapted from a 1933 Fannie Hurst bestseller (which had already been filmed in 1934), it tells the story of two single mothers, a struggling white actress named Lora (Lana Turner) and a black woman named Annie (Juanita Moore). When their young daughters become close, the women move in together but as Lora’s star ascends, Annie settles into the role of her friend’s maid. Fast forward 10 years, and Lora is the toast of Broadway while Annie is suffering the heartbreak of an ungrateful daughter, Sarah Jane (Susan Kohner), who is able to pass for white. (Meanwhile, Lora’s grown daughter, played by Sandra Dee, is falling for mom’s patient, handsome, wooden boyfriend, played by John Gavin. As always, the men are interchangeable in melodrama.)\n\nThe movie’s as overheated as Sirk can make it, with hothouse colors, a swooning soundtrack, bottomless deep-focus photography, and a wide, wide screen to frame all those wayward emotions and dark pools of shadow. And it’s easy to laugh at if you’re a complacent moviegoer who believes that anything made in an earlier era has to be blinded by what you believe were the assumptions of that era. Say, for instance, the distressing fact (to a modern moviegoer) that Lora thinks she’s treating Annie as a “friend” while surrounding herself with black hired help, or that she can be shocked when she learns Annie even has friends outside the home. Didn’t Sirk see the irony of his own movies?\n\nWell, duh, of course he did. That’s one of the reasons he made them — to sneak contentious, dissonant social ideas to mass audiences within the Trojan Horse of soap opera. Sirk got his start as one of the more radical stage directors in post-World War I Germany, using lighting techniques and psycho-symbolic realism to impart classic plays with “seelenraum,” or “soul room” — an inner psychological reality embodied by the manipulation of stagecraft. He was also drawn to movies because he liked what he called “dramas of swollen emotion.” In short, a talent made to simultaneously create and subvert Hollywood melodrama.\n\nWe have mixed feelings about Sirk’s larger-than-life characters because he wants us to. Lora is nominally the heroine of “Imitation of Life,” but she’s a neglectful mother and a vain, shallow twit — not for nothing is she played by the earnest but limited thespian Turner. Even our feelings toward Annie are complicated by the way Sirk frames her looming over her tormented daughter, insisting that Sarah Jane take her proper back seat in a racist society. She’s a helpless monster of affection.\n\nInstead, our sympathies go entirely over to the movie’s “bad girl,” Sarah Jane, and Kohner gives an achingly vibrant performance as a young woman increasingly trapped by the world (and beaten in one scene by her white boyfriend, played by Troy Donahue!). The colors bleed in this film because life bleeds — we bleed — and because sometimes the only way to accurately reflect that is to crank everything up to 11. “There is a very short distance between high art and trash,” Sirk once said, “and trash that contains the element of craziness is by this very quality nearer to art.” Which may be as good a definition of melodrama as you’ll ever get.\n\nSo laugh if you want at “Imitation of Life” or any of Sirk’s primal cinematic operas. Although if you can laugh at the film’s end, when Mahalia Jackson herself sings “Trouble of the World,” I can’t help you. Just understand that when you laugh, you’re really laughing at yourself, and you’re laughing to keep from crying.",

        "instruction": "Also, using salvaged materials enhances a building’s LEED rating, an environmental distinction architects covet.\n\nThe parks department says it tries to reuse what it can but then allows contractors to sell, discard or give away the rest. (The city makes no money from it.) That is how an architectural salvage company in Philadelphia came to haul away 20 trailer loads of Coney Island wood in 2010.\n\nIt supplied the Barnes Foundation with about 6,000 feet of flooring — milled in Pennsylvania Amish country — from the thicker support beams beneath the boardwalk.\n\nScott Lash, a partner at the company, Provenance Mill Works, said Coney Island wood offered “a unique opportunity” to use an endangered material and yet feel good about it.\n\nAt the Barnes, the wood is in the elevator and staircases, and a border to the oak floors in the 23 galleries, but is most striking in the Light Court, the soaring entrance hall. Arranged in a herringbone pattern 28 feet wide and 155 feet long, the refashioned boardwalk forms a tapestry of caramel, red and chocolate hues — the original colors revealed by stripping the wood’s gray skin.\n\n“Green” products have seemed synonymous with California, and in Venice, Calif., a star chef has embraced the ethos of reclaimed wood. Travis Lett, 33, of Gjelina there, originally went to Provenance’s yard to buy Pennsylvania bluestone with his designer, Sam Marshall.\n\nThey saw the wood and were intrigued, especially since Mr. Lett grew up in Morristown, N.J., and recalled going to Coney Island as a child. They had it trucked cross-country, then laid it on the floors, shower and deck of Mr. Lett’s renovated 1,500-square-foot home blocks from the beach.\n\n“Combining these resources from the East Coast and reusing them in this way is very California,” Mr. Lett said. “I love being connected to the source.”\n\nThe source could not have been any closer for Michael Sarrel, the owner of Ruby’s Bar and Grill on the Coney Island Boardwalk. For two years, a new landlord threatened to oust his and other longtime boardwalk establishments, and only after tense negotiations could he sign a long-term lease in December — provided he would renovate the bar.\n\nWhen he saw boardwalk planks in garbage bins on Stillwell Avenue and 15th Street, 100 feet from his restaurant, he got the demolition crews to give him 10,000 feet without charge, Mr. Sarrel said. But using the wood ended up costing him well over $10,000, he said, and posing unforeseen challenges: extracting the beams from the joists, and taking out all the nails and screws.\n\nCarpenters cut through the wood as hard as stone to form tables, walls, the ceiling and the bar.\n\n“We want to keep the place looking old, but looking new,” Mr. Sarrel said. “We want it to look clean, but look dirty.”\n\nMr. Sarrel had stored the lumber in the lot of a flea market, but when it prepared to open this spring, he rushed to get rid of his surplus. Gwen Schantz, the chief operating officer of Brooklyn Grange, an urban farm located on a roof in Long Island City, Queens, answered his Craigslist advertisement and paid him $500 for 1,500 square feet of wood. Mr. Sarrel posted another advertisement and gave pieces away as souvenirs.\n\nMs. Schantz had a 60-by-15-foot deck built for Brooklyn Grange, hauling the wood with the help of Build It Green! NYC, another Brooklyn nonprofit organization.\n\nBuild It Green took the surplus and sold it for about $2 a foot to roughly 20 people, including designers.\n\nAnthony Malat plans to make a desk, maintaining the familiar silver color. “When you get the boards wet,” he said, “they still smell strongly of the ocean.”\n\nAlan Solomon, an owner of Sawkill Lumber of Brooklyn, supplied it to designers who used it for patio planters at Palazzo Chupi, Julian Schnabel’s five-unit condominium in the West Village, and on tables at Think Coffee on 14th Street.\n\nA Brooklyn furniture company, Uhuru, made a line of five Coney Island designs, including a lounger curved like the Cyclone roller coaster that retails for $7,500. It was chosen for the craft show next month at the Smithsonian’s Renwick Gallery in Washington.\n\nAlthough the preservationists are pleased to see the material finding new life, the issue is “double-sided,” said Todd Dobrin, the founder of Friends of the Boardwalk, a group dedicated to saving the wooden boardwalk.\n\n“It’s frustrating because it shows the quality of the wood is good and strong enough so that if you maintain it properly it would last a lot longer,” Mr. Dobrin said.\n\nBut the parks department’s chief spokeswoman, Vickie Karp, said: “The recycled lumber is not suitable for use as a boardwalk. It cannot withstand the weight or the weather.”\n\nThe department did recycle the wood directly to another park. The McCarren Park pool opened on Thursday in Brooklyn after a 30-month renovation with Coney Island wood (milled to reddish brown) on the walls of the corridors and fitness and changing rooms.\n\nScott Demel, the project manager for Rogers Marvel, architect for the McCarren renovation, said, “It was an opportunity to use the wood and tell the story about it.”\n\nThat story ends where it begins, on a boardwalk that since opening in 1923 has been perpetually reinventing itself. The city has filled the space beneath the planks with sand, and its new plan for some sections is to combine concrete with recycled plastic lumber. But at Ruby’s, in business since 1934, history endures.\n\n“It’s the last place in Coney Island,” Mr. Sarrel said, “where you can still walk under the boardwalk.”\n\nA version of this article appears in print on June 30, 2012, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: No Cyclone or Hot Dogs, but Still the Boardwalk.

        "instruction": "It has been a rocky few weeks all over the world. Only a few surprising presidential poll results have broken through in a news cycle dominated by shootings by and of the police, the F.B.I.’s decision not to indict Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump’s vice-presidential pick, more terror in France and an attempted coup in Turkey.\n\nIn truth, around 50 state and national polls were released this past week. Individually, they have sometimes felt as chaotic as the news around the world. But together they tell a far clearer story: Mrs. Clinton holds a modest but clear lead heading into the conventions.\n\nWhile the occasional poll has looked good for Mr. Trump, it has been two months since he led a national survey that included voters without a landline telephone. Mrs. Clinton has led dozens.\n\nHer lead is smaller than it was last month, before the director of the F.B.I. said he would not indict Mrs. Clinton, though he excoriated her for using a private email server as secretary of state. But she retains an advantage — perhaps by 4 percentage points nationwide, and a similar margin in the battleground states that are likely to award the electoral votes needed to win the presidency.\n\nThis straightforward story can get lost in the headlines, which tend to give the most attention to the most surprising results — whether it’s a predicted Clinton landslide or a narrow lead for Mr. Trump in key states.\n\nThe truth is probably somewhere between those extremes. Pollsters aren’t joking about the “margin of error”: the inevitable random variance in polls that exists simply by chance. If Mrs. Clinton leads by 4 points, you should expect polls that show her with a big lead or locked in a tight race, with others clustered around the average. That’s more or less what we saw this past week.\n\nIt’s a lot like baseball. Even great baseball players go 0 for 4 in a game — or have rough stretches for weeks on end. On the other end might be a few multihit nights with extra-base hits, or a spectacular few weeks.\n\nSometimes, these rough stretches or hot streaks really do indicate changes in the underlying ability of a player. More often, they are just part of the noise inevitable with small samples. Taking more polls is like watching more at-bats, and you need many if you want to be confident about whether a candidate is ahead or tied.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton were up by a modest margin, there would be plenty of polls showing a very close race — or even a Trump lead.\n\nA simulation of 100 surveys, if Mrs. Clinton were really up 4 points nationally.\n\nRecent polls NYT/CBS News Tied Marist Clinton +3ABC/Post Clinton+4 NBC/WSJ Clinton+5CNN Clinton+7\n\nA simulation of 100 surveys, if Mrs. Clinton were really up 4 points nationally.\n\nRecent polls NYT/CBSNews Tied Marist Clinton +3ABC/Post Clinton +4 NBC/WSJ Clinton +5CNN Clinton +7\n\nThe “margin of error” doesn’t even include the various distinctions among pollsters, like whether a pollster screens for likely voters, calls cellphones, conducts polls online, or makes many other choices hard to discern from opaque public releases.\n\nFor whatever reason, the Quinnipiac polls consistently show Mr. Trump doing better than NBC/Marist polls do, even though they appear fundamentally similar. Add these differences on top of the inevitable random error and it’s surprising that there haven’t been more polls showing Mr. Trump ahead.\n\nThe polls tell a very clear story about the country’s divisions in an era of sweeping economic and demographic shifts. For white voters with a college degree and nonwhite voters, the 2016 presidential election must look and feel like a landslide. Mr. Trump trails by as large or larger margins among these voters as John McCain did in 2008.\n\nBut the story is very different for white voters without a college degree, who remain a very large bloc of voters in the electorate. Here, Mrs. Clinton is doing far worse than President Obama last time. On balance, these two shifts have canceled out — leaving Mrs. Clinton ahead by roughly the same margin as Mr. Obama was in pre-election polls from 2012.\n\nEarly 2016 polls look a lot like pre-election polls in 2012, except with a far larger education gap among white voters.\n\nPresidential vote preference of registered voters in live-interview pre-election surveys, 2004–2016.\n\nPresidential vote preference of registered voters in live-interview pre-election surveys, 2004–2016.\n\nPresidential vote preference of registered voters in live-interview pre-election surveys, 2004–2016.\n\nThese big demographic divides have added confusion to the polls in battleground states. Those states have such different demographic characteristics that Mrs. Clinton has seemed to fare very well in some states while struggling in others.\n\nOn balance, Mrs. Clinton is excelling in diverse and well-educated states like Virginia, Colorado and even North Carolina. But she is struggling to match Mr. Obama in less educated or less diverse places in the Midwest and Northeast, like Iowa, Ohio, New Hampshire, or even Maine’s Second Congressional District. Yet Mrs. Clinton appears to be tied or ahead even in these states. The combination gives her a strong advantage in the Electoral College.\n\nThe volatility could grow this week and next week, when the two parties hold their conventions. Typically, the party convention helps its candidate by a few percentage points in the polls, and sometimes more. The bounce typically fades in the few weeks that follow, but sometimes it doesn’t, permanently altering the race.\n\nIn general, the polls are far more predictive of the final results a few weeks after the conventions than they are immediately before. No modern presidential candidate who trailed in the polls several weeks after the convention has come back to win the popular vote. This isn’t to say it couldn’t happen, especially if the post-convention polls were fairly close. There have been instances in which the polls have moved considerably after the conventions, even if they didn’t contradict the result of the popular vote (as in 1976 and 1980).\n\nBut it does indicate that a post-convention lead is quite meaningful, even with weeks or months to go until the election. By that time, both candidates will have had many and fairly equal opportunities to unify their parties and make their cases to the broader electorate. If a candidate holds a clear lead at that point, it means a lot.\n\nThe Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life. Follow us on Facebook and Twitter.

        "instruction": "This year, I’m celebrating 23 years of marriage.\n\nIn addition to the joy of being wed to my best friend, I have a relationship that has economically lifted my life and that of my nuclear and extended families. Being married has netted results that neither of us could have dreamed of, coming from low-income households.\n\nAnd so I readily embrace the findings of a new report that makes the case that the retreat from marriage — especially among lower-income Americans, and the resulting change in family structures — is a major factor contributing to the economic inequality in the United States.\n\nIt may seem old-fashioned, but marriage matters.\n\nResearchers W. Bradford Wilcox and Robert I. Lerman have collaborated on a study that I hope will spur lots of conversation and programs to strengthen and encourage marriage.\n\nThe report isn’t about criticizing the life choices people make. There is no judgment in the findings. Rather, the research shows that stable, two-parent families decrease the chance of people ending up impoverished.\n\n“Changes in family formation and stability are central to the changing economic landscape of American families, to the declining economic status of men, and to worries about the health of the American dream,” Wilcox and Lerman write.\n\nWilcox is a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a professor of sociology at the University of Virginia who directs the school’s National Marriage Project.\n\nLerman is the Urban Institute’s fellow in labor and social policy and a professor of economics at American University.\n\nIn “For Richer, For Poorer: How Family Structures Economic Success in America,” Wilcox and Lerman break down their research into five areas. Yet I want to concentrate on one overarching finding: that lower marriage trends have shifted the economic fortunes of many families.\n\nThe median income of families with children would have been 44 percent higher in 2012 had we had the same level of married parenthood as we did in 1980s, the report says.\n\n“The data strongly suggest that had marriage rates not declined substantially among parents, many more families would have attained middle-class incomes, and the inequality across families would have increased at a slower rate,” according to Wilcox and Lerman.\n\nI was also concerned by their findings that the widening economic gap is exacerbated by the fact that adults with less education and fewer financial assets are choosing not to marry, while well-educated, high-earning adults are lifting their economic situation by tying the knot.\n\n“Thus, higher-income Americans are enjoying larger economic returns from marriage than they used to,” the researchers write.\n\nThey argue that there is a marriage premium we can’t ignore.\n\nIf you’re currently married and were raised in a two-parent household, the annual premium in household income is more than $42,000.\n\nBy no means are Wilcox and Lerman suggesting that people should see marriage primarily as a financial decision. Love should have something to do with it, too.\n\nIn a panel discussion on their report, Wilcox and Lerman also noted that we can’t shy away from looking at the impact on children when couples do not get married. Being raised without both parents present in one household is important because it affects their economic well-being, too.\n\nOne caution: As we talk more about the benefits of marriage, we need to show compassion in policies and programs for people who make choices that may very well result in more struggles for them and their children.\n\nAmong their recommendations, Wilcox and Lerman advocate expanding and improving vocational education programs to provide job opportunities for less educated adults.\n\nTo reverse the retreat from marriage, Lerman and Wilcox call for a number of policies, such as increasing the child tax credit and earned income tax credit. They also recommend a “success sequence” national campaign largely led by civic, religious, community, and business organizations. The term is courtesy of Isabel Sawhill and Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution.\n\nThis campaign, much like those to prevent teen and unplanned pregnancies, would stress a sequence of choices — an education, a job, marriage, children, in that order — to help establish a better economic foundation. It was the sequence my husband and I followed.\n\nWe spend a lot of time telling young adults to get a good education so that they can get a good job. The other part of that economic equation is trumpeting the benefits of a stable marriage.\n\n“In today’s polarized world, this will be a challenge, but it is one that ought to be surmounted on behalf of the next generation,” Wilcox and Lerman write.\n\nNone of this is meant to be judgmental toward anyone. But it’s vital that we step up efforts to reduce the marriage divide that is eroding the American dream and creating divergent destinies for far too many families.",

        "instruction": "Street view ... a still from Philippe Parreno's June 8, 1968 (2009). Photograph: Serpentine Gallery/Gautier Deblonde\n\nSnow drifts at the windows of the Serpentine Gallery and the glass is fogged, as though invisible children were clamouring against it. I write this on a day when real snow has fallen – and the ice on the Serpentine lake is authentic enough (just ask the waterfowl sliding and waddling on it). But the snowflakes in front of the gallery churn from a machine on the building's pediment, and the ghostly breath has been etched by acid on the windows. The idea that real and fake snow might fall as one, and that cold breath from inquisitive passersby might mingle with etched mist, somehow has a magical synchronicity.\n\nPhilippe Parreno's Serpentine exhibition is a delight. The Algerian has bought together four short film and video works – the longest lasts 10 and a half minutes – very different in tempo, subject matter and approach, for a show that might best be described as a single ensemble piece. As one film ends in one gallery, the blinds at the windows rise, while in the next space they descend and the lights go off.\n\nThis is not the first exhibition to attempt to locate works in such a theatrical setting. Albanian artist Anri Sala did something similar at the Couvent de Cordeliers in Paris in 2004, plunging the medieval convent into grey crepuscular light and lining the place with grey felt walls to create a backdrop for several very different works. But Parreno's show goes further. The whole exhibition is a kind of journey the audience has to follow. The experience feels communal, and I think this, too, is intended by the artist. He seems concerned with how long people spend looking at a single work: here, only one work is available to look at any time. The artist coerces us into going with him.\n\nParreno's film No More Reality opens the show. In 1991, he gathered together a group of schoolchildren in their playground in Nice and filmed them chanting \"No More Reality! No More Reality!\" The slogan was their own, as was their decision to chant in English. The colour is bleached, the sound poor. It is an old Betacam recording, further degraded through being reshot on the artist's mobile phone. It's like a memory of some bright but distant summer, and the chant itself recalls innocent childish enthusiasm and a kind of impossible idealism. The voices echo through the empty galleries like a kind of empty hope – or a declaration of what one finds in art galleries.\n\nThe second film, The Boy from Mars (2003), takes us to a tropical compound under a lowering sky. It is dusk, or dawn, in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Water buffalo wander in the half-light. Lights climb the sky as though we were beneath some busy flightpath, and stadium lights flare beyond the trees. An improbable technology is at work in a windswept hangar: an electricity generator powered by the buffalo themselves, hauling at some suspended weights. The power they generate also provided the electricity for Parreno's camera. The lights in the sky form a new constellation. The animals wallow in the pond, unconcerned, leaving squelching footprints in the saturated earth. A bovine eye looms in the lens. You can almost smell these creatures, along with the ozone in the heavy, prickling air. Who, you ask, is the boy from Mars? A witness to a dream? There is no plot. It is all about place, weather, a situation that might be fictive – except it really happened.\n\nThe next room shows June 8, 1968 (main picture), in which we are aboard a train carrying the body of Democratic presidential candidate Robert Kennedy, who has just been assassinated by Sirhan Sirhan, from New York to Washington. Crowds line the track as the train goes slowly by; they seem to be looking directly at us, but we look back, seeing what Kennedy never saw. Yet all is not as it seems: the journey is a re-enactment, restaged in California in 2009, and the crowds are hired extras. Parreno has mounted a camera on the observation car.\n\nOverhead, the sky is an impossible blue. Clouds of pollen blow across the pastureland. We pass girls in summer dresses; an old black woman with a parasol; a couple picnicking in a dappled glade beside the track. Black baseball players stand and look behind chain-link fences, and a boy leans on his bike as we clatter through small towns and under vivid skies. At one point the camera lingers on a girl in a dinghy, rocking on placid, silent water, the blue filling the screen; at another, we pause before a magnificent tree on a grassy Californian hillside. The tree seems like a witness too – but to what? History, perhaps. You want to capture these images and hold them, and look at them again. But they're gone.\n\nWhen Parreno and Douglas Gordon filmed Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait in 2008, 17 cameras followed the football player throughout the match. In a great catalogue essay, Michael Fried brings together his memory of Kennedy's death, Zidane's absorption in his game and obliviousness to the attention he is getting, and the way the trackside spectators follow our fictive journey on the train through California. He weaves in his own preoccupations about art and film, Diderot and Kant, and what it means to be a spectator and a subject of art. Fried has been writing about such issues for almost a half-century. It is a compelling text.\n\nParreno's latest work, Invisibleboy (2010), is a portrait of a young illegal alien in New York's Chinatown. Spectral monsters including giant rabbits are scratched directly onto the film stock – the creatures of the child's imagination, hiding in amongst the coats and under the sink, inhabiting the cluttered apartment where he lives and running like quicksilver in the gutters of a Chinatown alley. In Zidane, Parreno and Gordon used Mogwai's post-rock to great effect, and here the soundtrack is by Montreal band Godspeed You! Black Emperor. The music (Rockets Fall on Rocket Falls) has great urgency and drive, and somehow manages to be at once paranoiac and elegiac.\n\nThe whole of Parreno's show presents itself as a metafiction, and it is impossible not to weave a narrative with its complex images and the world Parreno has created. Something similar happened in Pierre Huyghe's new film, The Host and the Cloud, which closed last weekend at Marian Goodman Gallery in Paris – a short film that arrested me for two whole hours. As it happens, it had a rabbit in it too, though that one was a hi-tech alien avatar. Parreno has collaborated with Huyghe in the past and there remain concordances between their works – not least the question of what is real and what is staged, and how we as spectators negotiate not just their works themselves but also the conditions under which they are shown. It is never just a matter of plonking yourself down and losing yourself. But then it never should be.",

The country is the world's tenth-biggest producer of the commodity, according to the International Energy Agency, and will begin to auction off its resources from the beginning of next year, with eager majors already signing non-commercial \"cooperation\" agreements with Pemex.\n\nExxonMobil, Malaysia's Petronas, India's OGNC and Argentina's YPF are four companies that have recently inked deals to explore business opportunities in the country, but 154 oil companies from 34 countries were present at an industry conference on the beaches of Cancun in September.\n\nPemex hopes that the industry reforms - signed into law by President Enrique Peña Nieto in 2014 - will bring in $80 billion annually.

He also highlighted anecdotal evidence that suggested criminals park tankers in the middle of the oil fields and force government employees to fill them up.\n\n\"Compliance tends to be absolute for very good reasons,\" Boué added.\n\nPemex statistics, given at the IISS meeting, revealed that criminal groups stole over $1 billion in hydrocarbon resources during 2012 and 2013. They also showed that illegal taps into state-owned pipelines had increased by one third over the year to date, compared to the same period last year, with total losses of around $1 billion.\n\n\"For a criminal organization this is a huge business...it has become a huge side business for the drug cartels,\" said Gustavo Mohar, CEO of risk analysis firm Grupo Atalaya, which is based in Mexico City. \"They are not motivated by political things, ideological things, it's simply money… Rich, violent, immoral, without limits.\"\n\nRead MoreHow Mexico's cartel crackdown smashed its iron industry",

That was the reason why they wished for me to sign the affidavit bringing the emails into evidence,” he said, referring to an affidavit he signed at the request of Asic as part of its continuing investigation into Gregg.\n\nGregg is now chief executive of a listed company called Primary Healthcare.\n\nSasse told the hearing that he raised concerns with former Leighton executives in 2012 about alleged corruption linked to their company’s foreign operations.\n\nHe said some of his information was “without question” handed to Leighton’s board at the time, but there seemed to be a “distinct lack of interest” to pursue the allegations with board members of subsidiary companies overseas.\n\n“I was surprised at the lack of interest, the lack of support, and then eventually the fact that the whole investigative process was shut down,” Sasse told senators.\n\nAllegations of alleged bribery linked to Leighton’s overseas operations first surfaced in 2012, with several former executives resigning in response.\n\nIt changed its name to CIMIC Group last year – standing for Construction, Infrastructure, Mining and Concessions – in a bid by its new Spanish owners to distance it from the bribery allegations.\n\nFederal police and Asic are still investigating former Leighton executives over the company’s dealings between 2009 and 2011, with claims of alleged bribery linked to a multimillion-dollar oil pipeline in Iraq.\n\nThe evidence comes after Fairfax Media reported it had been given a compulsory order from Asic to hand over files belonging to corrupt Monaco-based firm Unaoil as part of Asic’s investigation into Gregg.\n\nThe files reveal millions of dollars of offshore payments by Australian companies, including Leighton Holdings.\n\nThe Labor senator Sam Dastyari told Sasse that his evidence on Friday was remarkable.\n\n“What you’re saying is sensational in that it outlines a culture of behaviour and conduct that goes beyond isolated incidences,” Dastyari said.\n\n“It also looks like what you’re saying is at every point of time where you or others tried to raise concerns and address these issues, that you were removed from being able to do so.”\n\nSasse replied: “I agree. It’s grounds for concerns from a public policy perspective.”\n\nThe Senate inquiry into foreign bribery was established in June last year after Dastyari said he had evidence to implicate a number of senior business figures in corrupt behaviour.",

        "instruction": "I’ve had an Apple Watch for a little over a week now. The most common question people ask you when you’ve got Apple’s wearable computer on your wrist is, “Has it changed your life?” Which is an odd question to ask about a gadget that starts at $349 and is, in large part, an accessory to your phone.\n\nBut the question points to the peculiar state Apple and its customers find themselves in at the moment. Anticipation and chatter about the Watch is high, but few people have actually seen one in the wild. The Watch’s rollout is unique compared to previous Apple products in that customers can, for the most part, only order it online and that initial supply appears to be extremely limited.\n\nSo has the Apple Watch changed my life? No. But it is an incredibly well-designed, compelling product. (I’m wearing a 38-millimeter stainless-steel model, which retails for $949 with a matching link bracelet.) A full review is coming—once the blush of newness has worn off—but in the meantime, here are the most surprising things about using an Apple Watch:\n\nThe battery life is very good.\n\nOne of the most prevalent initial concerns about the Watch was how long its battery would last. Presenting the device, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he personally recharged his every night, suggesting about a day’s worth of charge. And yet, many were skeptical.\n\nHappily, this quasi-promise turns out to have been on the conservative side. I’ve been wearing the Watch during fairly long days (7AM-10PM) and have yet to have it flip into reserve power mode, which limits some functions while preserving time-telling. Most days, even ones that include a half an hour to an hour of exercise, the Watch has had about 20% battery left when I pop it into its charging cradle in the evenings.\n\nMORE The Odd Thing Apple Banned from the Apple Watch\n\nThis is all the more impressive since I’ve been poking and prodding it more than I might once I’ve worn it for a few months. There is a caveat, several days of charge would allow sleep-monitoring, something many dedicated fitness trackers now do by default.\n\nThis may seem obvious, but I find the design to be one of the Watch’s chief virtues. All of Apple’s products are deeply thought-through and finely milled. But the Watch isn’t just a gadget, it’s fashion. It’s just a nice looking object. And much of the time, that’s all it is since the screen automatically turns off to preserve power.\n\nThe Watch doesn’t have a built-in keyboard. Which makes sense since typing on it would be difficult, if not impossible. If you want to search for a location in Maps, send a text message, or set an alarm or timer, you can dictate using a version of Siri, Apple’s digital personal assistant. This works incredibly well. I routinely find myself lifting my wrist and saying “Hey Siri,” which launches the Siri app. From there, using Siri is very much the same as on an iPhone or iPad (though, the Watch implementation doesn’t talk back).\n\nPeople don’t notice it (much).\n\nAside from a few Apple diehards who honed onto my wrist like heat-guided missiles, few people seem to notice I’m wearing a smartwatch. This is comforting since, I’ll admit, I was a little worried about making a statement. This may owe to a preference for long-sleeve shirts or to having the smaller version. Whatever the reason, it’s nice to not have to have a conversation about the Watch unless I choose to, say, by obnoxiously and grandiosely offering to tell a coworker the time even though she never asked.\n\nThere are lots of apps.\n\nAnd some of them are pretty good. Apple is initially limiting how much access app developers have to the Watch’s underlying hardware, like the heart rate monitor for instance. That limits some of their functions, but also likely helps preserve battery life and minimize software conflicts. That also means, in practice, a lot of third-party apps are limited. My favorite so far: Nike+ for running, taxi-hailing service Uber, Hue to control my apartment’s smart lighting, Instagram, and one more I’ll get into below.\n\nMORE The New Apple Ad Will Break Your Heart into a Million Tiny Pieces\n\nApple loaned me a link bracelet and a white sport band. Switching the bands is extremely easy—and addictive. I’ve been swapping them out depending on whether I plan to exercise or not, but I could see having a range of bands depending on what I’m wearing, et cetera. Much like accessories for the iPod, iPhone, and iPad before it, I anticipate the secondary market for Watch bands becoming considerable in scope.\n\nAnd an obvious bonus: TIME looks great on it.\n\nNot a surprise, really. And I’m clearly biased, but if you have an Apple Watch, make sure to check out our app. More details here.\n\nRead next: Why Tattoos Might Be a Huge Problem for the Apple Watch\n\nListen to the most important stories of the day.",

For this reason Spaniards have taken to calling their beloved Ibérico the four-footed olive tree.\n\nThere is only one problem with this delicious, healthful, environmentally friendly product: you can't get it here. Fear of disease has made it illegal to bring Ibérico hogs, or their meat, into the United States. This may change soon, said Don Harris, the owner of Latienda.com, an importer of artisanal Spanish products. Last week he returned from a trip to Spain, where he visited a new slaughterhouse in Córdoba that the U.S.D.A. has indicated it will consider approving. \"They expect production could begin around March 2005 for the U.S. market,\" Mr. Harris reported.\n\nIbérico hogs arrived in America with the second voyage of Columbus. The conquistadores who followed him often left breeding stock at promising landfalls, confident that should they ever return, there would be hogs aplenty. The 700 pigs that Hernando De Soto took with him from Cuba to the Southeast in 1539 were the foundation stock of hundreds of thousands of pigs that once roamed the forests of the Southeast.\n\nAs Americans moved west, they turned much of the wilderness into cornfields. Faster-growing, less mobile breeds of pig were perfected for the barnyard and sty, so that farmers could market their surplus on the hoof. Meanwhile the Ibéricos and their descendants -- suited to life in the wild -- all but disappeared. But I suspected that their DNA survived in isolated pockets in much the same way that old English ballads survived in the isolated hamlets of Appalachia.\n\nI received exciting affirmation of this when I came across the writings of I. Lehr Brisbin Jr. of the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, an author of \"Wild Pigs in the United States.\" In that work he refers to the hogs of Ossabaw Island as descendants of Ibéricos.\n\nIbéricos! In America? I had to get my hands on some. In his reply to my enthusiastic e-mail message, Dr. Brisbin cautioned that one could not simply go and get a pig off the island without risking importing disease. More distressingly, the state of Georgia had begun a program to exterminate the Ossabaws, citing the threat they pose to endangered loggerhead turtles.\n\nDr. Brisbin encouraged me to contact Dr. Michael Sturek at the University of Missouri, who was conducting diabetes research with Ossabaws that he had taken off the island a year ago. With the assistance of the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, I enlisted Dr. Talbott, whose oft-repeated mantra is \"Upscale, designer pork for high-end consumers and chefs.\"\n\nHis interest in artisanal pork landed him a grant from the multimillion dollar fund established in the tobacco settlement of 1999. With that money, Dr. Talbott had set up a pilot program that provided hogs, expertise and a guaranteed market to small farmers in North Carolina who wanted to stay in farming but had few alternatives outside of tobacco.\n\nWhen I told him about Dr. Sturek's Ossabaws, Dr. Talbott eagerly agreed to purchase 23 of them, which is how and why we acquired the truckload of pigs that we drove across America's heartland. We delivered half of the animals to Emile DeFelice's Caw Caw Creek Farm in St. Matthews, S.C., where they would subsist on acorns and grasses supplemented with peanuts, another traditional pig feed high in omega 3.\n\nThe shy animals entered their new environment tentatively. Frightened by the barking of of Mr. DeFelice's dog, they drew themselves into a tight circle, manes bristling. But when it was apparent that the even-tempered hound meant them no harm, they started to explore their new home, crunching on newly fallen acorns.\n\nTwo days later, we dropped off the remaining Ossabaws in Mebane, N.C., at the farm of Eliza Maclean. Ms. Maclean did not yet have access to a forest, so she planned to raise her group in a large paddock, feeding them peanuts, alfalfa and acorns from an enormous oak in her pasture.\n\nThe pigs took on weight quickly, and by December Mr. DeFelice was able to ship me half of an acorn-fed pig. I braised the shoulder slowly and savored my first bite. The taste was right, but the meat could have been juicier.\n\nA month later Ms. Maclean's pigs had fattened up nicely and were ready for the pan. She sent one to Donna Lennard, the owner of Il Buco in New York, where the chef, Ed Witt, prepared a loin eye dusted with fennel pollen that delivered waves of exquisite porkitude.\n\nFor purposes of comparison Mr. DeFelice sent me a Farmer's Hybrid (the genetic line that Niman Ranch prefers) that had been allowed free range of his forest. Interestingly, it exhibited equally powerful taste and succulence, leading me to suspect that any pig hardy enough to live outdoors and munch acorns or peanuts will produce superior pork.\n\nAccording to Dr. Talbott, scientific analysis of the Ossabaw meat indicated that the pigs that were fed acorns averaged 14.7 percent more monounsaturated fats than conventionally fed hogs. The breed was thrown a lifeline in September when Slow Food U.S.A. placed the Ossabaw on its metaphorical ark of endangered breeds that have been singled out for preservation efforts. As Erika Lesser, who is Slow Food's executive director, described Ossabaw pork, \"It just tastes better than other pigs.\"\n\nThe environmental side of the story is similarly promising: if we raise pigs in the forest environment in which they evolved, or at least allow them the exercise and the primeval diet of their wild past, we will have better pork. Exploiting acorns as animal feed would mark a return to a renewable and free resource that could help to reclaim our woodlands. And if this practice knocked a few points off our national cholesterol average, that would be nice as well.\n\nPeter Kaminsky is the author of the forthcoming book \"Pig Perfect: Encounters With Remarkable Swine\" (Hyperion).",

        "instruction": "A global crackdown on corruption. The mere words are enough to make the heart sink. They conjure up, at best, images of inept and leaden-footed regulators closing old loopholes half as fast as financiers and lawyers exploit new ones, in a great game of legal whack-a-mole; at worst, it’s those who trumpet their virtue most loudly that are most guilty.\n\nAt U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron’s grandly-titled Global Anti-Corruption Summit Thursday, the room was predictably full of earnest frowns and the air thick with well-meaning declarations. The host sternly called it “the cancer at the heart of so many of the world’s problems,” while Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund’s managing director, detailed in an essay a new study that put the annual cost of corruption to the world’s economy at between $1.5 and $2 trillion–roughly 2% of the world’s gross domestic product.\n\nThe ways in which corruption saps growth are many, said the IMF: it weakens the state’s ability to raise revenue, increases the cost of public procurement, raises the market cost of borrowing for any company perceived to be in a ‘corrupt’ jurisdiction, and makes government over-reliant on using the central bank to create the money that government fails to raise, creating a bias towards inflation.\n\n“If you are pro-growth, you must be against corruption,” Lagarde warned solemnly in a message to the summit.\n\nSome skepticism is allowable: Cameron has only recently been pressured into admitting his past use of offshore investment vehicles, while Lagarde is due to stand trial for “negligent” stewardship of public money while Finance Minister of France (the essence of the accusation is that she turned a blind eye to a big payoff to a businessman who was promising to support her boss Nicolas Sarkozy in the next election campaign). Both Cameron and Lagarde deny any wrongdoing.\n\nBut Cameron’s summit has produced a bit more than words. Under pressure to lead by example after the embarrassment of the Panama Papers, he has announced plans for new legislation that will stop off shores laundering money through the notorious London real estate market. The U.K. is setting up a public register where companies that own property will be required to disclose their beneficial owners (that is, the ultimate owner rather than the offshore-based shell company on the deeds of title). A similar register will be set up for companies that seek business contracts with the government. In a separate move, the U.K. is also looking at making its banks legally liable for the AML violations of their employees, in an effort to make them take their responsibilities more seriously.\n\nThe NGO Transparency International last year published research that showed how the U.K’s real estate market–in particular, London’s–had become a magnet for corrupt funds: at least 122 billion pounds’ ($176 billion) worth of property was held through offshore companies in jurisdictions with high levels of secrecy in 2014, it said.\n\n“Anonymous companies are the getaway car for the corrupt, for criminals and for terrorists,” Martin Tisné, a U.K. government adviser at investment firm Omidyar, told the BBC Thursday. “If you steal a hundred pounds, you can put it under your mattress, if you steal ten million pounds, what do you do? You set up an anonymous company and buy a house in Notting Hill.”\n\nAnother 12 countries declared their intention to introduce similar registers Thursday. These included Nigeria, where the problem of graft in public contracting has been endemic for decades. Cameron had, embarrassingly, been caught on camera telling Queen Elizabeth earlier in the week that Nigeria, and Afghanistan (whose president Ghani was also attending the summit) were ‘two of the most corrupt countries in the world.”\n\nTransparency International was among those who seemed reasonably impressed.\n\n“The real issue of how corruption works — secrecy — is being tackled,” its chairman José Ugaz said in a statement. “More governments have committed to ensuring that information is made public making it harder for the corrupt to hide their illicit wealth. But we will need to see the laws in place and enacted before we can claim any victories.”\n\nA large part of the remaining problem remains ultimately in Cameron’s backyard. Many of the world’s offshore financial centers, from Gibraltar to the Cayman Islands, are the remote remnants of the British Empire, and offshore finance is their only real export service. Neither the Cayman Islands nor the British Virgin Islands were at the summit (The Daily Telegraph reported that they weren’t invited for fear of causing Cameron embarrassment).\n\nThere are also mutterings at the behavior of the U.S., where states such as Delaware and Nevada still allow a high degree of confidentiality to companies and investors. The U.S. has also refused so far to sign up to an initiative backed by the G-20 to clamp down on tax evasion by making the tax authorities of every country automatically share relevant information with their peers (yesterday, the OECD announced that Panama and a handful of other recalcitrant offshore jurisdictions had finally signed up to it).",

        "instruction": "Peter Snow, who has died aged 81, had occupied a unique position in the cultural life of Britain since the second world war, as a painter, theatre designer, teacher and interventionist. He was also a larger-than-life character, flamboyantly bohemian, a keen biker, a lover of \"happenings\" - already by the 50s a true child of the 60s - and a much loved and influential head of theatre design at the Slade School of Fine Art between 1967 and 1992.\n\nHe designed the British premiere of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, directed by Peter Hall at the Arts Theatre in 1955. The blasted tree demanded by Beckett stood upstage, behind a grim scrim which parted to reveal the tramps in baggy, pinstriped trousers, battered bowlers and dinner jackets - Snow also designed the costumes - skewered by fate in a bleak terrain of stones, a wooden box and an upturned dustbin.\n\nSnow had been working in the theatre since 1951, when he designed Love's Labour's Lost for the Southwark Shakespeare Festival before joining Joan Littlewood, who remained a lifelong friend, at her Theatre Workshop in Stratford East. Two of his most admired designs for Littlewood in 1954 were for the first revival in 300 years of John Marston's The Dutch Courtesan, with Avis Bunnage and George A Cooper, and George Bernard Shaw's The Devil's Disciple with Harry H Corbett as the charismatic Dick Dudgeon.\n\nOther early theatre work included designs for Lennox Berkeley's one-act opera A Dinner Engagement at the Aldeburgh Festival in 1954, Frederick Ashton's ballet Variations on a Theme by Purcell at the Royal Opera House in 1955, and Noël Coward's South Sea Bubble, starring Vivien Leigh at the Lyric Theatre in 1956.\n\nHis first solo show as a painter was at the Prospect Gallery in London in 1951, followed by an important exhibition at the Beaux Arts in 1957, and he would move from the gloomy, so-called \"kitchen sink\" school to a much more eclectic, colourful style over the years, a transition that was completed during a life-changing Churchill fellowship at the end of the 1960s.\n\nHe stopped first in New York and was astonished by the vigour and excitement of the performance art and avant-garde theatre of that time, before moving on to Mexico to study ancient rituals, masks and the Day of the Dead. Out of this came some of his most vivid painting and two multi-media entertainments, Reflections. The first was held at Oval House in south London in 1971, the second at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1975, which combined elements of tantric sex, motorcycle gear with glam-rock accoutrements and a bevy of naked dancers, doves and magicians.\n\nSnow was an open-minded and adventure-seeking maverick who defied his sensible background in Catford, south London, where his father, Frederick, was a civil engineer (later knighted for his work on the Kingsway underpass at the Aldwych, central London, and Heathrow airport). In 1946, he studied briefly at Goldsmiths College and worked as a journalist on the South London Press before national service with the Royal Engineers in the Middle East.\n\nHe began his association with the Slade with a scholarship there, studying until 1953 and joining the staff in 1957. He was head of theatre design, succeeding Robert Medley, whose key role in the pre-war period was an authenticating factor in Snow's own great success as a teacher. Teaching became his life's work.\n\nStudents at the Slade included Derek Jarman, Yolanda Sonnabend and Philip Prowse, the last two forming, with Sally Jacobs, a formidable teaching triumvirate, with Prowse as professor. Snow was heartbroken when the theatre design department was discontinued after his retirement.\n\nSonnabend recalled that Snow was both a fantasist and a gentleman, and averred that his paintings, particularly some of the murky, rainy ones that he did of the Kennington area of south London in which he lived, are seriously underrated. He was always witty and delightfully prone, after a drink or two, to say the wrong thing. He began a speech at a dinner to mark the retirement of an otherwise popular Slade director with the remark: \"We all know Bernard's a bit of a shit ...\"\n\nProwse, who went on to be an inspirational director of the Glasgow Citizens Theatre in the 1970s, believed Snow to be much influenced by the Belgian painter James Ensor, a precursor of surrealism. He loved fairgrounds and carnivals, street lights reflected in puddles, all such signs of urban magic. He designed a famous Coppélia at a time when the piece was seldom seen, and Prowse recalled with gratitude that he put his name forward for a significant Sleeping Beauty at the Dutch National Ballet. \"He was a very generous man, and he didn't begrudge his students being cleverer than him - which didn't happen very often anyway.\"\n\nSnow designed a BBC film about Rex Whistler in 1978 and continued to exhibit regularly at the Beaux Arts and, after it closed down, the Piccadilly and Albemarle galleries. His occasional portraits include studies of Joan Littlewood and Richard Eyre, the film and theatre directors, which hang in the National Portrait Gallery.\n\nIn 1963 he married Maria Wirth, an Australian colour consultant and interior designer. She died last December and he is survived by their daughter, the painter Selina Snow. In recent years he had suffered from Alzheimer's disease.\n\n• Peter Frederick Briscoe Snow, painter, theatre designer and teacher, born June 6 1927; died August 29 2008\n\n· This article was amended on Saturday October 4 2008.

Shorten made the comments at Guardian Australia’s marriage equality event “Why Knot?” on Thursday.\n\nThat email prompted Wollondilly Young Liberals vice-president of development, Jeremy Travers, to write to the NSW Liberal party on Tuesday complaining about the possible use of party membership lists by Marriage Alliance.\n\n“I have been informed by a few Young Liberals and former Young Liberals that they too have received this email and they are not subscribed to any email list from Marriage Alliance,” he said.\n\n“Therefore, I would like to request an investigation into whether the party, an employee or a member gave Marriage Alliance access to membership lists or whether Marriage Alliance illegally or improperly accessed the lists.”\n\nGuardian Australia has spoken to one former Young Liberal member who resigned in 2012 who had “never touched the Marriage Alliance, but got their communications anyway”.\n\nA second person who was a financial member of the NSW Liberals between 2005 and 2012 said they received the 5 April email despite never having any involvement in Marriage Alliance.\n\nThe NSW Liberal party told Guardian Australia “the Liberal party has received several complaints and is currently investigating the matter”.\n\nRelated: Joe Bullock quits Senate over Labor's compulsory support of marriage equality\n\nThe Coalition government’s policy is to hold a plebiscite on marriage equality after the next election. It has not yet decided the question for a plebiscite or whether it would allow exemptions to anti-discrimination law.\n\nMarriage Alliance has come under scrutiny for links to the Liberal party, including that York has previously run as a Liberal party candidate in Brendan Nelson’s former seat of Bradfield.\n\nGuardian Australia contacted York and Marriage Alliance for comment.\n\nA spokesman for PR firm Hugo Halliday, Nathaniel Smith, told Guardian Australia the firm had acted for Marriage Alliance in 2015 but only handled its media relations, not email campaigns. Smith denied Hugo Halliday or its employees were involved in accessing Liberal members’ contact details. “We didn’t have anything to do with that.”\n\nThe 5 April Marriage Alliance email claimed that “Shorten said that under no circumstances would he allow for religious freedoms to be considered if the Marriage Act were to be redefined in Australia to include same-sex marriage”.\n\nShorten’s position was that Labor would not allow changes to discrimination law, which prohibits discrimination based on sexuality – such as bakers refusing to make cakes for same-sex weddings. He did not oppose provisions in same-sex marriage bills which would allow ministers of religion to refuse to perform ceremonies.\n\nNevertheless, the email claimed “in a direct attack on people of every faith in this country, the Labor party has sent a very clear message – we do not respect your views, we do not respect your values, and we will make them illegal”.",

But he’s back at it again, now working at UBS, where he covers enterprise technology companies—that is, companies that sell technology to other companies as opposed to consumers. Milunovich is still paying careful attention to HP, which announced last week that it is splitting its consumer PC and printer businesses (to be called HP Inc) from its enterprise hardware and software lines (to be known as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise).\n\nReaction to the spin-off, beyond general praise for spin-offs, has been tepid. Writing in The New York Times over the weekend, James Stewart walks through HP’s generally weak prospects on both sides of its house. In his weekly “Monday Note,” Jean-Louis Gassée provides outstanding historical commentary on HP’s culture, calling the company today a “tired conglomeration.”\n\nAs for Milunovich, he finds some reasons for guarded optimism about HP. I reached him at his desk in New York last week. Below is an edited version of our conversation.\n\nI wrote in an essay on the day the split was announced that HP didn’t much matter anymore, at least not the way it used to. Do you agree?\n\nHP’s obviously lost a lot of luster. It’s not the company it once was. But it is one of the largest consumer computing companies. Clearly Apple AAPL has surpassed it. But HP is very close to being the number-one PC company globally. They are the premier printing company. Where they have faded is on the enterprise side, and the innovation halo they once had is long gone. But I wouldn’t say it doesn’t matter. I think that’s a bit of an exaggeration.\n\nTalk about your 2005 prediction.\n\nI apparently predicted that printers would be peeled off from PCs. I’ve always been a big believer in focus. It’s the most powerful factor in business. In the case of HP we always felt it was difficult being the premier consumer and enterprise company. Microsoft MSFT clearly has had similar issues. In HP’s case there’s no silver bullet. No one unit is being held back. But it doesn’t encourage focus. I would argue that they should have done this years ago.\n\nAs you note, HP isn’t separating printers and PCs, meaning the Compaq acquisition is remaining somewhat intact.\n\nI’d argue that the Compaq acquisition wasn’t so bad. If you were going to try to be a major computer company, the Compaq deal made some sense. It’s not unlike the rumored EMC EMC and HP combination currently [rumored], which could make some sense. Back then HP was weak in x86 systems [a type of computing based on Intel processors] and storage. Compaq gave them both. Clearly they would not be in the market position they are in today if they hadn’t done that acquisition.\n\nWhat is your assessment of HP’s management?\n\nThey’ve lost so much talent over the years. I don’t think it can ever be what it once was. But I do believe CEO Meg Whitman has made improvements. We did a conference call recently with Mohamad Ali, HP’s chief strategist. Meg has brought to HP this “Playing to Win” approach, which Procter & Gamble PG uses. She learned it there because [P&G CEO] A.G. Lafley used it in the 2000s. They have this strategic framework. I had never heard boo about this. It’s nine to 12 months old. I heard she had an offsite with the top 100 or so managers at HP. And she said, “I want you all to read this book. I’m going to test you on it.” The flight attendants noticed. They wanted to know why everybody on this flight to Las Vegas was reading the same book. It gives you a sense of the discipline there.\n\nHP has been talking a lot about the cloud lately, but I don’t have a sense of how its cloud computing strategy is different from the competition, several of whom have been at it longer than HP.\n\nIn general, observers are unclear. We talked recently to Bill Veghte [the head of HP’s enterprise group and a longtime Microsoft executive]. They’ve had three different management teams running their cloud strategy. The IT has been rebranded as Helion. It has several features, many of which aren’t available yet. So, for HP, that is a work in progress.\n\nToward the end of her article almost a decade ago, Carol Loomis asked Carly Fiorina who the leading technology company of the day was. Fiorina responded that there was no one company, but in retrospect Apple exerted far more than its fair share of leadership. What would your answer be today?\n\nApple today is clearly the world’s leading consumer tech company. And IBM is the leading enterprise company. But Microsoft, Oracle, and HP aren’t far behind. The HP Inc company is probably pretty close to half consumer and half enterprise. There’s still the question of how HP fits in. I think the split is to better position the enterprise side. They are vulnerable there. Their cloud strategy is unclear to people.\n\nLast question: How about you? What’s different today from your previous stint as an analyst?\n\nIt’s very similar to the early ’90s. We’re going through one of those disruptive periods when everything is changing. The lesson for investors is this: Get out of the incumbents and focus on the pure-plays. Going out to Silicon Valley is even more depressing than it was in the 1990s, with new players saying they are going to destroy the incumbents. It’s depressing because my clients own the companies that are under attack. But EMC and IBM—and even HP—are not going away quickly.",

        "instruction": "The Powerball jackpot is at $1.5 billion and rising, easily ballooning to the biggest lottery prize of all time—which actually raises the value of a single ticket. But unless the winner is Puerto Rican (no federal income taxes or territorial tax on gambling winnings), he is also likely to have to pay taxes of equally historical significance.\n\nThere are many misconceptions that float around the taxation of lottery prizes. And the truth is the issue is complicated, not just because many consider the lottery to be a regressive tax, but because the amount one pays in taxes depends on a few different factors, most notably including where you live.\n\nMost stories about lottery prize taxes highlight a federal income tax withholding of 25% for winners. But that’s not actually the highest bracket of federal income tax. Big jackpots are instead taxed at 39.6%.\n\nRead Next: The One Time It’s Mathematically Advantageous to Play Powerball\n\nIf we’re talking a cash lump sum, which everyone but four people has taken since 2003, and the takeaway for the current $1.5 billion jackpot is $930 million, the winner must pay $368 million in federal income tax. (That’s the tax bill for an American winner. Interestingly, if a Canadian won, only 30% would be withheld, and the amount taxed could be much less because Canada doesn’t tax lottery winnings. And yes, Canadians are crossing the border to play Powerball, just like people in Alabama, Utah, and other states that don’t offer Powerball are crossing state borders in droves to buy tickets.)\n\nAlthough the taxes you’d pay with a lump sum payout is much higher per year than the annuity, both options have you firmly in the deep end of the tax bracket. (Though if Ted Cruz, for example, were to win and somehow enacted a 10% flat tax, you’d be glad you picked the annuity.)\n\nRead Next: Why the Powerball Jackpot Has Soared So High So Quickly\n\nBear in mind that these are only the federal taxes. Unless you live in Florida, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, or Wyoming, where there are no state income taxes, you’ll have to cough up a state tax as well.\n\nHere’s what you should tack onto your tax budget (in millions) according to the state where you live, courtesy of USA Mega, a site that tracks the numbers.\n\nArizona $46 Arkansas $65 California No tax on lottery winnings. Colorado $37 Connecticut $62 Delaware $61 District of Columbia $79 Florida No tax on lottery winnings. Georgia $56 Idaho $69 Illinois $35 Indiana $32 Iowa $47 Kansas $47 Kentucky $55 Louisiana $46 Maine $46 Maryland $81 Massachusetts $46 Michigan $39 Minnesota $67 Missouri $37 Montana $64 Nebraska $47 New Hampshire No tax on lottery winnings. New Jersey $28 New Mexico $55 New York $82 (if also in NYC it goes up to $118) North Carolina $53 million North Dakota $37 Ohio $37 Oklahoma $37 Oregon $74 Pennsylvania No tax on lottery winnings. Puerto Rico No state or federal taxes on lottery winnings. Rhode Island $56 South Carolina $65 South Dakota No state income tax. Tennessee Only income tax on income from stocks and bonds. Texas No state income tax. US Virgin Islands No tax on lottery winnings. Vermont $55 Virginia $37 Washington No tax on lottery winnings. West Virginia $60 Wisconsin $72 Wyoming No tax on lottery winnings.\n\nIn other words, if the winner of the Powerball jackpot lives in New York City, he’d fork over a grand total of $486 million in taxes ($368 million in federal, $118 million in state and local taxes), and the net payout on the $930 million lump sum option would be “only” $444 million.",

        "instruction": "A new video by “artist” James Franco purports to interpret and modernise the Renaissance art of the Della Robbia family, by pouring transparent gel over models’ understandably grimacing faces. It is not just worthless in itself, but exposes the bankruptcy of the 21st-century cliche that you can set the art of today confidently beside the art of the past in a way that somehow liberates it from the dust of museums.\n\nSotheby’s commissioned Franco, an actor who has convinced himself he is a great artist, to create his Della Robbia video to promote – sorry, “respond” to – its New York exhibition Glazed: The Legacy of The Della Robbia.\n\nFranco takes the idea that contemporary artists have something important, or at least cool, to say about the Renaissance, and trashes it. His video is desperate – a ludicrously overstrained attempt to sexualise and sensationalise something he obviously does not find at all interesting in its own right. As slimy wet cold stuff pours over flesh, Franco begs us to see the glamour of glazed ceramics. But in reality it is far easier for most people to see the merit of the Della Robbia dynasty than it is to comprehend the value of cheap performance art with lashings of erotic gel.\n\nThe Della Robbias churned out bright and breezy reliefs … pure and pretty, full of life and humanity\n\nThe Della Robbia style is charming, colourful and accessible. This talented family were the popular artists of 15th-century Florence. They made art to delight the innocent eye. While other Florentine artists were revolutionising painting and sculpture, they hit on a lovely method of covering terracotta with coloured glazes and stuck to it to churn out bright and breezy reliefs of the Nativity, decorative crests and garlands and fruits. Perhaps their most sublime creations are Andrea della Robbia’s swaddled babies flying in blue roundels on the front of the Hospital of the Innocents in Florence. This family’s art is both pure and pretty, full of life and humanity. Does anyone need to see models coated in slime to recognise its appeal?\n\nYet it’s unfair to blame Franco alone for his pointless intervention. Sotheby’s commissioned it, along with a monochrome poster that says GLAZED in a chic modern way. It looks as if they are anxious that art collectors don’t get the point of art from 500 years ago unless it is slicked up and made “new”.\n\nThis is just another of today’s often glib and frankly silly attempts to sex up art history. Even London’s National Gallery succumbed to the same insecurity when it got Jamie xx and other cool names to create “soundscapes” for its paintings. The Royal Academy felt it needed Jenny Saville to spice up Rubens, Versailles has brought in contemporary artists from Jeff Koons to Anish Kapoor to enliven this monument to French classicism, and you’ll be lucky to visit Pompeii without seeing some truly awful modern art among the ancient wonders.\n\nPerhaps even more clearly than the Della Robbia, the case of Pompeii illustrates the redundancy of a lot of contemporary “interventions” in history. Pompeii’s frescoes and frozen bodies fascinate visitors. Who needs modern art to make this place more interesting?\n\nCurators and the press often assume that people are idiots. In reality, great art finds its own audience, and bad art just gets in the way. And a lot of art today is bad, not because there are no talented artists around, but because in its drive for novelty, the art world has abolished quality control. Allowing James Franco to desecrate the Renaissance reveals how pathetic we look beside the cultural heights of history.",

        "instruction": "WASHINGTON — The first lady, Michelle Obama, bared her head in Saudi Arabia, but covered it at the Vatican and at an Indonesian mosque. Laura Bush wore a head scarf only briefly in Saudi Arabia and to tour the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. Hillary Rodham Clinton covered her head in Eritrea, the West Bank and Pakistan, but did not in Saudi Arabia.\n\nMrs. Obama inspired headlines and Internet chatter this week when she was photographed without headgear during a visit with President Obama to Riyadh, the capital of a conservative Muslim kingdom where women are compelled to cover their heads. But her attire was in keeping with diplomatic protocol and longstanding custom for Western women visiting Saudi Arabia.\n\nAnd that is no accident.\n\nThere are dozens of rules and customs that govern what an American first lady should wear and what she should not while visiting other countries, and first ladies have to follow them all.\n\n“Mrs. Obama always wanted to be briefed completely on all the cultural traditions, from food to greetings to attire, and we would prepare a detailed memo before each trip,” said Capricia Penavic Marshall, who, as the chief of protocol for the United States from 2009 to 2013, oversaw protocol matters for the president and first lady abroad.\n\n“These are not unilateral decisions she is making,” Ms. Marshall said. “No one just decides one day that this is what I’m going to wear. It is very carefully planned.” Mrs. Obama in particular, she added, “likes to be well-informed.”\n\nAdhering to the rules is an elaborate business for first ladies, whose every outfit and accessory is scrutinized for political significance and cultural import, particularly when traveling to countries where customs bear little resemblance to Western practice.\n\nWhen Mrs. Bush traveled to Saudi Arabia as first lady in 2007, she went bareheaded in public almost the entire time. But when a group of breast cancer survivors she met with surprised her with a handmade black hijab, or head scarf, with tinges of pink that signify breast cancer awareness, she immediately put it on in solidarity with the women.\n\n“It was a very organic moment,” said Anita McBride, Mrs. Bush’s chief of staff at the time. “Anyone would have done it. But there was a little bit of a flap about it.”\n\nThe hijab was a rare spontaneous episode in what are otherwise meticulously planned sartorial strategies on trips by first ladies. White House aides always prepare a “wardrobe memo” that accounts for cultural norms (head scarf or no?), climate and terrain (short sleeves or long? high heels or flats?), and the nature of the events (gown or suit?).\n\n“When you’re in the White House, you always tend to err on the side of being prepared,” Ms. McBride said. “The wardrobe memo was a very key ingredient and component of that.”\n\nIn Mrs. Obama’s case, the stop in Saudi Arabia was a late addition to her itinerary for a trip that was initially planned only as a visit to India. When King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia died on Jan. 23, President Obama hastily changed his plans and diverted to Riyadh to pay respects.\n\nIt is not clear whether Mrs. Obama knew in advance to pack for a visit to the kingdom, and the White House refused on Thursday to comment on any aspect of how Mrs. Obama chose what to wear.\n\nThe first lady dressed modestly, in loose-fitting black pants and a blue tunic-length blouse, with her arms covered by a three-quarter-length coat in a matching print.\n\nSome Saudi bloggers criticized her on Twitter, using an Arabic hashtag that roughly translates to #MichelleObamaUnveiled. Many Westerners, including Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, praised her for making a stand in defiance of Muslim law.\n\n“It turned out to be much ado about nothing,” said Melanne Verveer, who as a top adviser to Mrs. Clinton traveled extensively with her when Mrs. Clinton was the first lady. “Yes, your clothes do matter. Yes, they can be interpreted, but if you dress appropriately to the society you are visiting, you make sure that no one makes news with something not intended to make news.”\n\nLike Mrs. Obama in Indonesia in 2010 and Mrs. Bush in Jerusalem, Mrs. Clinton would cover her head when visiting a mosque, but not when meeting with officials in Muslim countries. The same is true for an audience with the pope at the Vatican, where women are expected to cover their knees and shoulders as well as their heads.\n\n“There may not be a code per se, but there was guidance from the State Department, and it was to be respectful, to be accommodating in conservative societies,” said Ms. Verveer, now the director of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security. “Don’t wear your sundress.”\n\nEven the best-laid wardrobe plans can go awry for a first lady, so Ms. McBride said she would often take head coverings for unforeseen events when traveling in the Middle East.\n\nShe slipped a few extra scarves into her luggage during a trip to Afghanistan with Mrs. Bush, and each woman grabbed one when they disembarked from Air Force One.\n\n“We put them around our shoulders just in case we might need to pull them on for any reason when we arrived,” Ms. McBride said. “You never know.”\n\nA version of this article appears in print on January 30, 2015, on page A17 of the New York edition with the headline: What to Wear?

Malaysian stocks suffered a 1.5 percent fall and the ringgit was stuck near a 17-year low.\n\nBut in a sign that nerves continued to settle in some quarters after the yuan devaluation last week, Japan's Nikkei and Australian stocks bucked the trend to gain 0.4 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively.\n\n\"As concerns over the Chinese yuan continue to ebb, and with the prospect of further rises in the dollar in the lead up to the Fed's (September) meeting, the Nikkei may well recover last week's losses this week,\" wrote Angus Nicholson, market analyst at IG in Melbourne.\n\nThe dollar was steady at 124.39 yen.\n\nThe yen was unfazed by Monday's data showing Japan's economy shrank in the second quarter. Though a contraction was expected, concerns that the third quarter may see only mild improvement could rekindle expectations of further monetary easing by the Bank of Japan.\n\nThe euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.1092, handing back some of the big gains made last week when the initial shock of yuan's devaluation pushed the dollar lower.\n\nThe greenback got a lift at the end of last week from encouraging data on U.S. producer prices and industrial output that helped support the case for the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates at its monetary meeting in September.\n\nMeanwhile, the People's Bank of China on Monday, setting the yuan's midpoint at 6.3969, a touch firmer than the previous session's fix of 6.3975.\n\n\"Stabilization in yuan fixes could clear the air for renewed dollar appreciation. With reduced volatility, fears on passthrough from the China devaluation to Fed policy should subside and this may see focus shift back to the situation in the United States,\" wrote Todd Elmer, head of Citi's G10 strategy in Singapore.\n\nSuggesting that global financial market interest had moved away from Greece and on to other matters like China's bid to weaken its currency, the euro drew little support even after the European Commission confirmed a deal to lend cash-strapped Athens up to 86 billion euros over three years.\n\nThe Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy of China-related trades, was little changed at $0.7380.\n\nThe Aussie sank to a six-year low of $0.7217 earlier last week after China's depreciation but recovered ground as Beijing stepped in to arrest the yuan's decline.\n\nWhile China's central bank says there is no reason for further weakening in the yuan, many traders suspect sluggish economic data and expectations of further policy easing will keep the currency under downward pressure.\n\nCrude oil, another market churned last week by China's shock move and its potential impact on demand for commodities, continued to struggle in the wake of global oversupply concerns.\n\nU.S. crude was down 1.4 percent at $41.91 a barrel, within reach of a six-year trough of $41.35 struck on Friday.\n\n(Editing by Eric Meijer & Kim Coghill)",

Although the Germans went right on producing planes and tanks, they were unable to supply them with enough fuel.\n\nThe heaviest destruction was wreaked on the centers of large German cities which are today only dunes of rubble surrounded by gaunt windowless walls. The smaller towns, villages, farm country and even the suburbs of the big cities were relatively undamaged.\n\nNot mentioned in that June ’45 issue of LIFE, but certainly worth noting here, is that the Allied bombing campaigns directed at some German cities — especially world-renowned cultural centers like Dresden — were controversial even at the time they were carried out. (Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., famously based much of the most brutal elements of his classic novel, Slaughterhouse-Five, on what he witnessed as a POW in Dresden in the aftermath of the attack, which killed tens of thousands of civilians.)\n\nIn fact, the strategy of bombing German cities — and German-occupied cities in France and elsewhere — throughout the war has been both defended and excoriated through the decades. But in light of Bourke-White’s stark, masterful aerial shots, there’s little room for debate on one salient point: if the bombings were meant to rain down maximum destruction, they succeeded with a grim thoroughness that remains shocking even today, seven decades after the air-raid sirens, the explosions and the screams of the living and the dying echoed in the ruins.\n\nLiz Ronk, who edited this gallery, is the Photo Editor for LIFE.com.

        "instruction": "The U.K., along with many other parts of the world, woke up Friday morning to the news that it had voted to leave the European Union in a historic referendum by a margin of 52% to 48%.\n\nBut the now official ‘Brexit,’ as it was dubbed in the media, has been a long time in the making. Here’s how and why the question of whether to remain within the E.U. or not was put to the British people in the first place.\n\n1. The last time a similar referendum was held was 40 years ago\n\nIn 1975, the ruling Labour government held a referendum on whether Britain should leave what was then known as the European Economic Community (EEC), the precursor to the European Union. The U.K. had not been a signatory to the Treaty of Rome that created the EEC in 1957, and had seen two attempts to join — in 1963 and 1967 — rebuffed by then French President Charles de Gaulle before it was finally being accepted in 1973, after de Gaulle’s tenure ended.\n\nThe referendum two years later, asking the question “Do you think the UK should stay in the European Community?” saw an overwhelming vote in favor of staying. Every British county except two voted “Yes” for a victory margin of about 67% to 33% with a 64.5% turnout.\n\n2. Many have tried and failed since then to hold another\n\nThe Labour Party’s attempt to win the country’s 1983 election on a platform of withdrawing from the EEC resulted in failure, with the Conservative government led by Margaret Thatcher being re-elected by a considerable margin.\n\nFourteen years later, four years after the EEC became the E.U. through the 1993 Maastricht Treaty, the newly formed Referendum Party of Sir James Goldsmith contested the 1997 general elections with a promise to hold a referendum on U.K. membership to the union. However, it only managed to win about 2.6% of the vote and did not capture a single seat in parliament.\n\n3. Cameron made a promise, and kept it\n\nThe current U.K. Prime Minister, David Cameron, rejected calls for a referendum on his country’s continued membership of the E.U. in 2012, but announced less than a year later that his Conservative government would hold one if re-elected in 2015.\n\nSoon after he was voted in for a second term, the European Union Referendum Act 2015 was introduced in the British Parliament to kickstart the process that culminated on Friday.\n\nSubsequently, in a speech to the Parliament’s House of Commons in February 2016, Cameron announced that the referendum would be held on June 23. A staunch advocate of remaining within the E.U., Cameron announced his resignation soon after the results of the vote were declared on Friday.\n\nThere is still a long road ahead, with the process of officially seceding from the E.U. set to take at least two years and with many factors to be considered, but the people of the U.K. have made their voice heard. Unlike 1975, this time they want to leave.",

Roughly 2.4 million employees are pulling up stakes each month, while the number of monthly open jobs has hit 4 million.\n\nThe increasing numbers show the economy getting stronger, the theory goes, because workers are getting confident enough to take on the risk of changing jobs—or leaving the workforce altogether. (Earlier this month, one woman felt confident enough to break the news to her boss in a SuperBowl ad, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn't break out how you give notice.)\n\n(Read more: US economy may be stuck in slow lane for long run)\n\nThe rise in unfilled job openings also means employers are having a harder time finding qualified candidates, which is usually a sign they'll have to start offering higher wages to fill those jobs.\n\nThat could help break the long streak of stalled growth in wages, which have more or less flat-lined since the Great Recession began. Higher wages help boost consumer spending, which spurs demand for goods and services, which in turn leads to more hiring. And the virtuous circle keeps turning.\n\nBut the story told by the JOLTS data isn't entirely good news.\n\nFor one thing, while more workers are quitting, employers haven't picked up the pace of job creation as quickly. Four years after job creation bottomed after the Great Recession, the pace of hiring and the number of job openings are still well below the same point in the recovery from the 2001 recession.\n\n(Read more: Stagnation by design)\n\nMany of the jobs being created demand workers with specialized or advanced skills that companies are having a hard time finding.

Robinhood, a new mobile-first brokerage that launched its iOS app today, lets users buy U.S.-listed stocks without paying a commission, a cost that typically runs individual investors $7 to $10 per trade.\n\nThe app’s slick interface lets users buy securities, track stock performance and keep tabs on their overall portfolio. Users don’t even have to maintain a minimum account balance, a common requirement of similar stock-swapping services.\n\n“People in our age group were not being exposed to what we consider a pretty useful tool for building your wealth,” says Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev. He and co-founder Baiju Bhatt launched Robinhood in beta for a few thousand users earlier this year. Already half a million people have signed up to request the app, indicating a heavy appetite for cheaper trades. These users will begin being on-boarded to the app today, and newcomers can download the app to join the waitlist and view different stocks.\n\nThe company, which has netted $16 million in venture funding from backers like Andreessen Horowitz and Google Ventures, plans to make money by letting investors trade on margin (basically issuing loans to let customers buy additional stock).\n\nWhether or not young investors really need a service that lets them buy stocks “as quickly as you can call an Uber,” as Bhatt puts it, is an open question. Most active stock pickers fail to outperform the overall stock market. During the first 9 months of 2014, only 9.3% of actively managed mutual funds outperformed the S&P 500, according to the Wall Street Journal — and those funds are managed by people whose job is to be good at picking stocks.\n\nTenev argues that stock-picking is a good way for young people to learn about investing. “It makes a lot of sense for a first-time investor who is an early adopter of technology and discovers companies through using their products and services,” he says.\n\nThat advice flies in the face of a lot of collective wisdom about investing, including from famed businessman Warren Buffet. But for those that are still confident they can beat the market and would like to attempt it more affordably, Robinhood will also be available on Android and on desktop soon.",

Much of the ruble’s decline in December was down to the fact that Rosneft, which usually provides a prop for the exchange rate by repatriating most of its export earnings, had to use them to repay billions of dollars to international banks. It then borrowed $10 billion worth of roubles to pay its taxes and wages back home, with the help of an accommodating central bank. (The company has to pay back another $4 billion this month, but that should be a less stressful experience for all concerned if oil prices continue to recover.)\n\nBP’s shares had risen 2.3% by lunchtime in London in response to the news, mainly because underlying profits, at $2.2 billion, were well ahead of the $1.6 billion consensus forecast.\n\nThe U.K.’s biggest oil major joined the crowd of oil majors slashing investment budgets in response to the drop in crude prices, saying capital expenditure would only be $20 billion this year, instead of the $24-$26 billion promised earlier.\n\nElsewhere, BG Group Plc BRGYY , another big U.K. oil and gas producer, said it would cut capex by some 30% to between $6-$7 billion, from $9.8 billion. BG also took a non-cash charge of $8.9 billion in the fourth quarter to reflect the reduced value of its portfolio of projects in a low oil-price environment, driving it to a net loss of $1.05 billion for the year.\n\nDespite the barrage of bad numbers, the stocks of both companies–and of the broader oil sector–have risen sharply in the last couple of days as crude prices have recovered to their highest levels since the start of the year.

That’s because the company issued an impressive update: Facebook FB users watch eight billion videos a day, doubling the number it announced in April.\n\nThe explosive growth came from two places: The first is autoplay video, which was a tiny product tweak that Facebook launched last year. When Facebook’s 1.55 billion monthly active users scroll through their News Feeds, videos start to play automatically.\n\nThe second is Facebook’s decision to prioritize videos in News Feed. Fortune noted this in a June feature story on Facebook video:\n\nFor creators with more than a million Facebook fans, photo posts reach 14% of their audience on average, and text-only updates reach just 4%, according to one manager of content creators. But video posts? They reach 35%.\n\nKeep in mind, eight billion daily video views is a vanity metric. YouTube (and its stars) have pushed back on Facebook’s video view count, noting that Facebook has a lower bar for what counts as a view. Any video that plays for three seconds or more counts as a view on Facebook. With autoplay starting every time a user pauses on a video, it’s easy to rack up views for videos that weren’t really watched.\n\nYouTube counts a view as 30 seconds or more. In fact, YouTube stopped supplying total view counts in 2012, preferring instead to rely on how many hours of video people watch.\n\nFacebook likes to tout the way News Feed fuels the discovery of new videos. “The vast majority of content is people discovering things browsing through their News Feeds,” Zuckerberg said on Thursday’s earnings call. “That’s very powerful and not something [other places] are able to do at scale in a very big way.”\n\nFacebook has a roadmap for the ways it will enhance the video-watching experience on the site (including a big one it announced last month), he said. Deploying a favorite phrase of Facebook’s highly media-trained executives, Zuckerberg said, “It’s early days.”\n\nFacebook has no near-term plans to host long form video content like TV shows and movies, but rather, the company hopes content producers will “chunk up their stuff” and post clips from their shows to Facebook, Zuckerberg said. He cited Jimmy Fallon’s popular Facebook videos as an example. “I’m quite excited about adding some more dimensions to video on Facebook,” he added.\n\nRead more on Facebook video:\n\nHow Facebook’s video-traffic explosion is shaking up the advertising world\n\nYoutube CEO: ‘Video views on Facebook are different’\n\nFacebook’s video monetization plan is here\n\nFacebook unrolls new tool to help video owners stop “freebooting”\n\nFacebook will now inject videos directly into your bloodstream\n\nSubscribe to Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.\n\nYou can follow Erin Griffith on Twitter at @eringriffith, and read all of her articles here.",

It feels like it is the end of the world to me,” the actress/animal rights activist told Pop Tarts at last week’s Big Bluff Online Trivia Game launch. “I’m working with international bird rescue, they’re expecting (it to get a lot worse) which is unbelievable. It’s the worst thing that could happen, and we won’t know what the effects are until later.”\n\nAnd as thousands of gallons of oil continue to spill every day, it seems the majority of Hollywood, a community often given to preaching on \"green\" issues, is staying away. Granted, there were some celebrities like Conan O’Brien and Jimmy Fallon who took to Twitter to express their thoughts on the issue, but unlike the tragedy in Haiti in January, there hasn’t been an outpouring of donations, large-scale fund-raisers, contribution-driven websites and hotlines, or PSAs encouraging Americans to do all they can to help out.\n\n“Hollywood stars have a romance with saving foreign countries, they see America as this rich and powerful country that should fix problems on its own,” said media expert Michael Levine. “Celebrities feel heroic in saving people from other places.

Queen Latifah, Sean “Diddy” Combs and Pharrell Williams hosted another telethon in conjunction with BET, and Sean Penn even hightailed it to the poverty-stricken country to personally lend his hand with refugee efforts.\n\nBut according to other entertainment industry experts, it’s not a case of celebrities only wanting to help out foreign countries: it’s a case of this being a man-made disaster as opposed to a natural one.\n\n“It's politically safer when its victims on one side and a catastrophic event on the other. In that case, there is only one side to be on. Man-made catastrophes are not as clear-cut.

You don't want to make those victims part of an 'evil' oil company that created the mess. It's complicated, which makes it a very tough issue to rally around.”\n\nMedia expert Dana Livingston Ward echoed Selig's sentiments.\n\n“We're all referring to this environmental mishap as ‘the BP oil spill,’ which automatically places blame on BP, therefore no one - Hollywood included - feels the need to pay for a problem caused by someone else,” said Ward. “In the end, the Gulf oil spill is an issue that does indeed affect our people, so celebs and the rest of Americans should be just as quick to help create a solution for this latest disaster... even if it's simply speaking up to raise awareness and thus force the guilty party to remedy the situation in more timely manner.”\n\nStill, there are some stars that aren’t afraid to bypass the politics to do what they can for the sake of the environment and those affected.\n\n“Waterworld” star Kevin Costner, who 15 years ago began funding the work of Louisiana-based firm Ocean Therapy solutions, has offered up his multi-million dollar machines which function like a vacuum to separate water and oil, purifying both in the process. Director James Cameron has loaned the submersibles used to shoot “Titanic” to the crews trying to stop the underwater geyser, and Robert Redford appeared in a commercial encouraging Americans to “Call For Clean Energy Now.”\n\nIn addition Lenny Kravitz, John Legend, and Mos Def recently performed at a benefit for the Gulf Relief Foundation in New Orleans to raise funds for fisherman affected by the disaster, and 90’s pop sensation Sophie B. Hawkins is donating 100 percent of the net proceeds from her new song “The Land, the Sea & the Sky” to the Waterkeeper Alliance’s clean-up efforts in the region.\n\nBut despite her concern over the wildlife affected by the spill, Anderson has faith that President Obama, despite the harsh criticism he has been under for not doing enough.\n\n“I (totally blame) the oil people. They made a big mistake of not having a back-up plan,” Anderson added. “I would definitely like to see Obama do more, but I also want to support him and what he stands for. I think he’s a good president and he’s very compassionate, and we have to just trust that he knows best.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Deidre Behar",

        "instruction": "The Newman precedent is no more.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld the insider trading conviction of Bassam Salman, and with it unanimously rejected a finding by an appeals court two years ago in a landmark case, United States vs. Newman. The Newman case had temporarily rewritten insider trading rules and made it much harder to prosecute such crimes. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court seemed to say that revision was a mistake.\n\nWeighing in on an insider trading case for the first time in almost 20 years, the eight-member Court said it had \"easily\" affirmed that Salman was guilty: Salman, a grocer, had knowingly traded on confidential information that came from his brother-in-law, an investment banker at Citigroup (c), reaping more than $1.5 million in illicit profits.\n\nWhile government prosecutors had a \"seemingly slam-dunk, shave-and-a-haircut case against Salman,\" as Fortune editor-at-large and legal expert Roger Parloff wrote, the issue the Supreme Court justices had to consider had much broader implications for many other, far less clear-cut insider trading cases.\n\n\"The government was concerned because [the Newman decision] would have left large holes in the insider trading law,\" says Arlo Devlin-Brown, a partner at law firm Covington & Burling and a former federal prosecutor who worked on insider trading cases. \"Salman largely fixes that.\"\n\nBut the question remains: How much?\n\nSalman's case had worked its way up to the highest court only after an appeals court in a separate insider trading case in Dec. 2014 overturned the convictions of two hedge fund managers. United States v. Newman dealt a major blow to the government's efforts to crack down on insider trading. In vacating those convictions, the appeals court set a new standard for prosecuting insider trading, requiring proof that the person providing the illegal trading tip—the tipper—had received money or another valuable benefit in exchange for the tip. No money for the tipper, no insider trading.\n\nThe Newman decision set off a domino effect, invalidating charges in more than a dozen other government insider trading cases, sparking a slew of new appeals and even aiding billionaire Steve Cohen in his potential return to the hedge fund industry after Cohen's firm pleaded guilty in a record-setting insider trading case.\n\nRead more: Inside Billionaire Steve Cohen’s Comeback\n\nLawyers for Salman had also tried to use Newman, arguing that Salman's brother-in-law never personally benefited from providing insider tips. But the Supreme Court flatly rejected this, saying that giving inside information to \"a relative or friend\" is in itself enough of a quid-pro-quo personal benefit. It's \"the same thing as trading by the tipper followed by a gift of the proceeds,\" the Court wrote in its opinion. Salman's conduct, the Court added, \"is in the heartland\" of rules that define insider trading.\n\nRead more: The Hedge Fund Trader Who Beat the Feds\n\nStill, the Supreme Court's Salman decision isn't an automatic win for the government in other insider trading cases going forward—and it doesn't completely overturn the Newman cases's findings, either. Todd Newman, the former Diamondback portfolio manager and namesake defendant in the Newman case, was so far removed from the initial source of the insider tip that prosecutors couldn't even prove he knew it was illicit when he traded on it. The Salman decision wouldn't have been enough to put Newman in jail because \"this case does not implicate those issues,\" the Court wrote in a footnote to its opinion Tuesday. Indeed, the Salman decision doesn't clearly define what the Supreme Court considers a \"friend,\" says Devlin-Brown. \"One question is what if it’s just a distant relation like a third cousin or some sort—I think that’s somewhat of an open question,\" he says. \"Does a friend include someone who is your Facebook friend whom you’ve met maybe never?”\n\nHere's what the Salman ruling means for some high-profile insider trading cases:\n\n(Alleged) Insider Trader: Leon Cooperman\n\nWhen the SEC charged Omega Advisors CEO Leon Cooperman with insider trading in September, the hedge fund manager denied the accusations and said the Justice Department had \" determined not to pursue charges for the time being pending the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Salman v. United States.\" That means Cooperman's reprieve may be coming to an end. Now that the Salman case is resolved and the decision went in the government's favor, federal prosecutors are more likely to bring criminal charges against Cooperman.\n\nStill, even with the most recent ruling, the Cooperman case may not be a slam dunk for the government. The arguments in the Salman case concerned \"the classical theory of insider trading liability\" as laid out in the landmark case Dirks v. SEC in 1983, which applies when a corporate insider, or someone he tips, trades in his own company's stock based on nonpublic information, according to another footnote in the Supreme Court opinion. But Cooperman is an investor who runs a hedge fund. He's not a corporate insider. Rather, the government accused him of trading on material nonpublic information that he'd \"learned in confidence\" from a company executive and promised not to trade on. Therefore, the prosecutors' case against Cooperman falls under a separate insider trading doctrine called \"misappropriation theory,\" which was established in United States v. O'Hagan in 1997, when \"the defendant breaches a duty to, and defrauds, the source of the information.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's \"personal-benefit analysis applies in both classical and misappropriation cases,\" it wrote in the Salman decision—but the government may still have a tough time proving Cooperman breached a duty or defrauded the corporate insider by trading on the tip.\n\nImpact of ruling: Unclear but mostly bad\n\nA former Goldman Sachs (gs) board member, Rajat Gupta was convicted and sent to prison in 2012 for passing nonpublic information about Warren Buffett's impending investment in the bank during its troubles in the 2008 financial crisis. The recipient of those illicit tips, Raj Rajaratnam, the now-infamous Galleon Group hedge fund manager who was convicted of insider trading as part of a large-scale government crackdown, is not getting out of jail anytime soon.\n\nBut Gupta, who was released from federal custody in March, is still trying to clear his name. Just last month, Gupta's lawyers argued in front of an appeals court that the former Goldman Sachs director's conviction should be overturned, as the jurors in the case were not told that they needed proof that Gupta had received a personal benefit for passing along the information before convicting him—which the Newman case decision set as a necessary condition for proving insider trading.\n\nUnder the Supreme Court's Salman ruling, however, appeals courts are likely to find that the relationship between Gupta and Rajaratnam was strong enough to pass the \"relative or friend\" test, and Gupta's conviction will stay intact.\n\nImpact of Salman ruling: Bad\n\nA former portfolio manager at Steve Cohen's defunct hedge fund SAC Capital, Mathew Martoma is serving prison time for trading on nonpublic information about an Alzheimer's drug trial. Cohen's firm had to pay more than $1.8 billion to settle insider trading charges. Cohen was never was never personally charged.\n\nMartoma's appeal lawyers were hoping to use the same argument of faulty juror instructions that Gupta's lawyers relied on, but now they can kiss that argument goodbye. Martoma's appeal is still pending.\n\nImpact of Salman ruling: Bad",

        "instruction": "Evil isn’t easy. Say what you will about history’s monsters, they had to overcome a lot of powerful neural wiring to commit the crimes they did. The human brain is coded for compassion, for guilt, for a kind of empathic pain that causes the person inflicting harm to feel a degree of suffering that is in many ways as intense as what the victim is experiencing. Somehow, that all gets decoupled—and a new study published in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience brings science a step closer to understanding exactly what goes on in the brain of a killer.\n\nWhile psychopaths don’t sit still for science and ordinary people can’t be made to think so savagely, nearly anyone can imagine what it would be like to commit the kind of legal homicide that occurs in war. To study how the brain reacts when it confronts such murder made moral, psychologist Pascal Molenberghs of Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, recruited 48 subjects and asked them to submit to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which could scan their brains while they watched three different scenarios on video loops.\n\nIn one, a soldier would be killing an enemy soldier; in the next, the soldier would be killing a civilian; and in the last, used as a control, the soldier would shoot a weapon but hit no one. In all cases, the subjects saw the scene from the shooter’s point of view. At the end of each loop, they were asked “Who did you shoot?” and were required to press one of three buttons on a keypad indicating soldier, civilian or no one—a way of making certain they knew what they’d done. After the scans, they were also asked to rate on a 1 to 7 scale how guilty they felt in each scenario.\n\nEven before the study, Molenberghs knew that when he read the scans he would focus first on the activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, a region of the forebrain that has long been known to be involved with moral sensitivity, moral judgments and making choices about how to behave. The nearby temporoparietal junction (TPJ) also takes on some of this moral load, processing the sense of agency—the act of doing something deliberately and therefore owning the responsibility for it. That doesn’t always makes much of a difference in the real world—whether you shoot someone on purpose or the gun goes off accidentally, the victim is still dead. But it makes an enormous difference in how you later reckon with what you’ve done.\n\nIn Molenbergh’s study, there was consistently greater activity in the lateral portion of the OFC when subjects imagined shooting civilians than when they shot soldiers. There was also more coupling between the OFC and the TPJ—with the OFC effectively saying I feel guilty and the TPJ effectively answering You should. Significantly, the degree of OFC activation also correlated well with how bad the subjects reported they felt on their 1 to 7 scale, with greater activity in the brains of people who reported feeling greater guilt.\n\nThe OFC and TPJ weren’t alone in this moral processing. Another region, known as the fusiform gyrus, was more active when subjects imagined themselves killing civilians—a telling finding since that portion of the brain is involved in analyzing faces, suggesting that the subjects were studying the expressions of their imaginary victims and, in so doing, humanizing them. When subjects were killing soldiers, there was greater activity in a region called the lingual gyrus, which is involved in the much more dispassionate business of spatial reasoning—just the kind of thing you need when you’re going about the colder business of killing someone you feel justified killing.\n\nSoldiers and psychopaths are, of course, two different emotional species. But among people who kill legally and those who kill criminally or promiscuously, the same brain regions are surely involved, even if they operate in different ways. In all of us it’s clear that murder’s neural roots and moral roots are deeply entangled. Learning to untangle them a bit could one day help psychologists and criminologists predict who will kill—and stop them before they do.\n\nRead next: What Binge Drinking During Adolescence Does to the Brain\n\nListen to the most important stories f the day.",

        "instruction": "We don’t know how long Margaret McKenna and Drew Meyer have been bickering, but now the question is: Can this marriage be saved?\n\nMcKenna is the embattled Suffolk University president, and Meyer is the chairman of the school’s governing board who has been orchestrating a coup to oust her. They’ve spent the past couple of days in what I could only imagine is the higher education equivalent of marriage counseling.\n\nTheir weeklong standoff may be coming to an end. On Thursday afternoon, Suffolk said that McKenna and Meyer have agreed on how to resolve issues between them. Details are being finalized, the school said, and the full board of trustees still must approve the proposal. The board meets on Friday.\n\nA faction of the board, led by Meyer, has wanted to let McKenna go after only seven months in the job. The group accused her of unauthorized spending and an “abrasive” management style. McKenna, a civil rights attorney who ran Lesley University for two decades, has refused to resign. Faculty, students, alumni, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, and business and civic leaders have rallied to her side.\n\nThis is the deal I’m hoping for: McKenna stays, and the Suffolk board cleans up its act.\n\nIn a letter, business and civic leaders urged the university’s board to use an independent mediator to resolve its differences with Margaret McKenna.\n\nUnless she is the most impossible person to work with in the world, McKenna has to remain at the helm for this reason alone: What other competent candidate wants to be Suffolk University president now?\n\nMeyer and his cabal have turned Suffolk into a clown college at the center of a three-ring circus. Martha Coakley, who appeared to be the leading candidate to replace McKenna, wisely hightailed out of there. No way the former attorney general and gubernatorial candidate was going to report to a bunch of Bozos.\n\nIn order to stay, McKenna will need to repair her relationship with the board, but it’s hard to see how both Meyer and McKenna can stay together for the sake of 8,300 students.\n\n“It’s awfully difficult to have a constructive and productive relationship between a board chair and president when the board chair appears to be the architect of the ouster,” said Richard Chait, a professor emeritus at the Harvard Graduate School of Education who studies university management and governance.\n\n“If the board determines she should remain, a change in the leadership of the board would be advisable, if not necessary,” Chait said.\n\nMcKenna is the fifth Suffolk president in five years after longtime leader David Sargent, James McCarthy, and two interims. Such turnover in the corner office is not “bad luck,” said Chait, but rather points to issues on the board.\n\n“Rapid turnover of presidents strongly suggests problematic governance,” Chait said.\n\nScott Harshbarger, a former attorney general who now advises clients on corporate governance, sees all kinds of problems with the Suffolk board, from potential conflicts of interest to breaches of confidentiality.\n\n“There are any number of failures to comply clearly with best practices,” said Harshbarger, senior counsel at the Boston law firm Casner & Edwards, who has been following the issues through the news media.\n\nSuffolk’s board practices are subject to review by the state’s attorney general, whose office oversees nonprofits boards and charities to ensure trustees uphold their fiduciary duties.\n\nAfter first demurring on the McKenna situation, Attorney General Maura Healey on Thursday weighed in. Her office said it has “questions” about why the trustees have yet to institute reforms at the prodding of the university’s accrediting agency, including updating its bylaws and becoming less involved in the day-to-day affairs of the school.\n\n“Good non-profit governance practices should be standard at sophisticated public charities such as Suffolk University,” Healey’s office said in the statement. “We believe that any decisions the Board makes must be done in the best interest of the students and the institution.”\n\nThis wouldn’t be the first time the AG had to provide adult supervision. Back in 2009, then-AG Coakley determined that Suffolk’s board had failed to follow its own procedures and other safeguards in monitoring a potential conflict of interest between a trustee and a contract with the school.\n\nHarshbarger has a soft spot for the downtown university, having hired many Suffolk Law graduates and having worked with them as colleagues. For the school’s sake, he said, he hopes the “board will, on its own, do the right thing.”\n\nThe right thing would be for Meyer to clean up board practices and be transparent with his fellow board members, McKenna, and the rest of the campus.\n\nFor her part, McKenna can pledge to do a better job of keeping trustees in the loop and, going forward, make sure they have the same goals.\n\nNow as for whether McKenna and Meyer can repair their relationship, only they know the answer. It’s hard to see how both of them can work together again, but it’s not impossible.\n\nIn 2012, Helen Dragas, head of the board of the University of Virginia, asked for the resignation of president Teresa Sullivan, just two years into her tenure. Sullivan agreed to step down, but after a groundswell of support from faculty and students she ended up staying.\n\nSullivan and Dragas must have worked out their differences because Sullivan is still president today, and Dragas remains on the board.\n\nBy reaching a deal, McKenna and Meyer have started to put the interests of the institution first. It can’t be about them anymore.",

        "instruction": "The Entrepreneur Insiders network is an online community where the most thoughtful and influential people in America’s startup scene contribute answers to timely questions about entrepreneurship and careers. Today’s answer to the question “How do you avoid hiring the wrong people?” is written by Susan Drumm, CEO advisor and leadership coach.\n\nHiring the wrong person could cost you and your company tens of thousands of dollars—maybe even hundreds of thousands, depending on his or her salary. In a 2013 CareerBuilder survey, 27% of U.S. companies said they lost $50,000-plus for each bad hire.\n\nI’ve spent the last two decades helping Fortune 100 companies build teams and hire right. Here are the five steps I coach my clients through:\n\nGet clear on exactly what you need, and interview based on that Outline what exactly you need in new team members. Which platforms should they be familiar with? Will they be working with customers, with you, or both? What sort of technical know-how is required?\n\nOnce you know what you’re looking for and you’ve started the interview process, forego the vague, hypothetical questions. Instead of, “Tell me about yourself,” try, “Tell me how you increased conversion rates for your last employer using social media.” When you know what you’re looking for, you’re more likely to find it.\n\nStart with a pool of at least five candidates—don’t just hire the first person who comes recommended Don’t try to shortcut the interview process. While interviewing and vetting multiple candidates is time-consuming, it can prevent you from hiring the wrong person. It’s tempting to hire the first person who comes recommended, but you’ll never know the inner workings of another business. One company’s outstanding performer might be your average employee. You might be interviewing someone who needs a hands-on manager, but what you need are self-starting, autonomous employees.\n\nSee also: What Everyone in Silicon Valley Gets Wrong About Hiring\n\nKnow your blind spots and weaknesses Truth be told, I’m not great at catching typos and could use a bit of help turning my coaching language into marketing language. Knowing that about myself, I looked for an assistant who excelled in those areas.\n\nHow do you find a team member who fills in your blind spots? Rather than asking them point-blank, “Are you good at catching typos?” (because most applicants will say they are), simply ask them what they’re good at. When you lead with open-ended questions, you’re more likely to get honest answers. You can also create a sample exercise that tests them on those skills.\n\nIf you’re not sure what your blind spots are, try the Enneagram personality test (or just ask your most brutally honest friend).\n\nIf you can’t meet in person, at least do a video call Body language and facial expressions are incredibly telling. How do the candidates behave when talking about previous jobs? How do they respond when you ask them about some of the less exciting tasks they’ve been asked to do? Do they seem engaged and open or anxious and closed off? These aren’t things you can necessarily tell from a phone interview.\n\nAsk for the references you’d like to speak to—not just the references they provide We’re all inclined to use references we know will speak highly of us. You’ll get a more complete picture of a potential hire if you ask to speak with a few more people.\n\nHere’s how to do that: “We talked about the project you worked on with X. Would it be possible for me to contact them so I can hear more about that project and your role in it?”\n\nBest-case scenario: The candidate gives you the contact information and you learn more about her as a potential employee. Worst-case scenario: She tells you she’s no longer in contact with that person or they had a falling out, which is also helpful information to have.\n\nWhen you put in more time and effort at the beginning of your hiring process, you’ll hire smarter, more committed, better employees—and save your company tens of thousands of dollars. It’s absolutely worth the effort.\n\nSusan Drumm is a leadership coach for entrepreneurs and CEO advisor with over 20 years of experience leading teams to exceed their potential.

        "instruction": "The last column was about evaluating advertising, a business expense that can be very pricey and wasteful if not done right. I thought it might be useful to offer some thoughts on evaluating another potentially wasteful and expensive process: corporate identity.\n\nIf you’ve ever been in a corporate identity or logo meeting, you’ll hear terms like glyphs, monoseals or dramatic angles. Colors are given feelings, shapes become dynamic or elegant or sensual. It can all be very confusing. So let’s start at the beginning in an effort to clear things up.\n\nLogos have been with us for thousands of years. A Babylonian clay tablet of about 3000 B.C. bears inscriptions for an ointment dealer and a shoemaker. The Roman legions had them. In the middle ages, every two-bit duke with a handful of knights had one plastered on their shields. There were crests or coats of arms everywhere. But none ever amounted to anything. What lived on were the names of the people involved or the places the big battles were fought. What does that tell you?\n\nIt’s not about the symbol. It’s about the name connected to the symbol.\n\nYou might say, “What abut the famous Nike swoosh I see on all those athletic shoes, shorts and shirts?”\n\nIt’s the Nike name that gives meaning to the Swoosh symbol. But they’ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars to link the two. So they can put it on clothing and not be quite as pushy with their name. It’s really only a stand-in for the name.\n\nIronically, it’s the successes of a Nike that leads other companies to say, “I want one of those.” Unfortunately, I once saw a piece of research on names and logos versus just the logos with the names taken away. You would be amazed at just how few logos are recognized without the name. Only a handful. Yet millions have been spent on logos like the General Electric monogram, the CBS eye or the Mercedes three-pointed star. And these symbols took years to establish. Your brand-new symbol probably has no chance of standing alone without your name.\n\nTake the most successful logos, such as Mobil or Hertz or IBM . All of those feature the name, not the symbol. Mobil has a red O. Hertz and FedEx have unique typography. The symbol that comes with American Airlines is simply AA with a set of wings in the middle. You could say in designing a logo, the name is the game.\n\nThere are other considerations in designing a logo. One is the shape. It should be rectangular because that is how you can see it best with your two eyes. If it’s too vertical or too horizontal it’s not as readable. The biggest mistake people make is allowing their logos to be hard to read.\n\nSome people, if you can believe it, use symbols that are bigger than the name. Others let designers pick a typeface to express what they feel are the attributes of the brand rather than its ability to be read quickly. Some chose typefaces that are illegible. Legibility is the most important aspect to look for in selecting a logo.\n\nTake Absolut Vodka. Their unique bottle shape is really their logo. And they’ve dramatized it with their visual advertising based on the shape.\n\nThe Jaguar automobile also has a unique shape, which functions like a logo that people quickly recognize. Jaguar is now owned by Ford Motor , and I’m beginning to see that wonderful, traditional shape being modified. That could be an enormous mistake.\n\nColor can also be important in a corporation’s identity. For example: Warm colors, such as red, orange and yellow, tend to jump out at you and attract attention. They have high energy and are good for retail. Blues are cool and conservative. They recede to the eye and are considered upscale. Bright colors are often described as casual and playful.\n\nYou preempt a color so that it becomes part of your identity.\n\nHertz is yellow. Avis is red. Kodak is yellow. Fuji is green. Coke is red. Pepsi is blue. FedEx is red and purple. UPS is brown. Color can be a colorful way to identify your brand. Just make sure you don’t pick your competitor’s color.\n\nYou might ask, what about logos that aren’t full names, like initials? Here is where you have to be careful. They only make good logos if they are nicknames of an established company name. General Electric is a long name, so GE makes an excellent logo, because it’s what people will use as a nickname. The same goes for FedEx instead of Federal Express or IBM instead of International Business Machines. Can you imagine trying to drag around a name like Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing ? It’s no wonder they became the 3M Company.\n\nBut remember, nicknames are given to you by the marketplace. It should be what people tend to call you. Don’t try to force it. If people tend to use your full name, that’s your name and that’s what should be your logo. Metropolitan Life Insurance can be MetLife . But New York Life will always be New York Life.\n\nSo there you have it. In picking a logo, it’s all about the name, and making sure it’s readable. The color and the typography are far more important than some meaningless symbol unless that symbol represents my nickname, and my nickname is only a nickname if it is used.\n\nWith more than 40 years of experience in advertising and marketing, Jack Trout is the author of many marketing classics, including Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind, Marketing Warfare, The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, Differentiate or Die, Big Brands Big Trouble and his latest, Trout on Strategy.

        "instruction": "It used to be that all a perfume-maker had to do to have a hit was line up a top celebrity like Justin Bieber or Lada Gaga and slap their name on a fragrance.\n\nBut times have changed, and Americans are increasingly turning up their noses at celebrity fragrances, inflicting a whole lotta pain on major companies such as Elizabeth Arden, RDEN maker of Britney Spears and Justin Bieber fragrances, and Coty COTY , the name behind Beyoncé and Gaga’s perfumes, quarter after quarter.\n\nArden on Thursday laid much of the blame for the 18% decline in sales of non-Arden branded products last quarter on “continued declines in celebrity fragrances,” a trend the New York-based parfumerie expects will persist. Similarly, Coty, the second biggest perfume-maker in the world after L’Oreal, reported comparable sales were flat last quarter, continuing a trend of lackluster results.\n\nWhile Coty did not call out any specific categories for the decline in its press release on Thursday, Chairman Bart Becht, in February told Wall Street analysts: “The mass fragrance part, in particular on the celebrity side in the U.S., is in decline.” In its most recent annual report, Coty had said sales of its Beyoncé and Gaga products had fallen.\n\nSo what’s going on? Are these companies simply lining up the wrong celebrities, or is something else at play?\n\nThe problem with celebrity fragrances, compared to say designer fragrances, is that they are typically low-end. And they are also largely aimed at younger consumers who get bored more quickly and move on to other products. Coty said as much in its annual report, warning that “there can be no assurance that these celebrity licensors will maintain the appropriate celebrity status or positive association among the consumer public.”\n\nIn contrast, designer fragrances by brands such as Michael Kors KORS and Tom Ford tend to be higher-end and stay in fashion longer because there is a more obvious link between them and a fragrance, as well as a consistency with their other offerings like clothes and handbags, leading to a bigger overall credibility with customers. What does a pop personality like Bieber know about the old art of parfumery?\n\nAnd the proof is in the numbers: as the Washington Post noted last month, sales in the U.S. mass fragrances (which include celebrity products), have dropped by half since 2000 to $600 million, while pricier perfumes have climbed 16% since then to a record-high $5.2 billion last year. That is borne out by the contrast between the financial results posted by Coty and Arden and the stellar performance of the higher-end Estee Lauder Companies EL , which has always eschewed celebrity products.\n\nElizabeth Arden, which is now desperately trying to course-correct to regain the luxury luster its namesake brand had years ago, made the mistake of doubling down on its celebrity business in 2012, when it bought Give Back Brands to get the global licenses for fragrances by Justin Bieber and Nicki Minaj. That bet has backfired spectacularly: Arden has taken a $44 million write down in the last 9 months. And it has pared it portfolio of celebrity brands.\n\nArden’s CEO, Scott Beattie, told analysts a few months ago, that it wasn’t clear whether this was a long-term, permanent decline or cyclical but he did say that it was unmistakable. “The rapid decline of that celebrity category over the last two years, both our brands and other vendors’ brands, has been disappointing,” he said.\n\nBut the company’s strategy to counter that is paradoxically compounding the issue: Beattie said Arden is lowering the number of products in the pipeline to reduce its exposure to celebrity fragrances. Yet fewer new products will result in lower sales since buyers of celebrity fragrances are always looking for something new to move onto. High-end perfumes like Chanel No. 5 are perennially top sellers.\n\nTo be fair, some new celebrity products have been hits: Arden’s fragrance for One Direction was the top launch in the mass-market segment of the industry in 2014. But increasingly it looks like the attraction of pop stars is fading for perfume-buyers.",

He would be sure to return it in a fortnight after taking a skim.\n\nReaders love borrowing books. Owners are often, understandably, reluctant to lend them. Loaning books is, after all, fraught with peril. Will a friend, colleague or acquaintance break the spine (a frequent and valid complaint of this Babbage's former flatmate), foul or dog-ear some pages, or disappear with the title, never to return?\n\nOn the surface, Amazon's and Barnes & Noble's e-book loan policy seems like the ideal solution to this age-old problem. Both firms allow lending of books, so long as the publisher agrees to it. Owners may lend their digital copy, though they can only do so once and for no more than a fortnight. As with traditional books, the title is unavailable to the owner during the loan period; and the work is deleted from the borrower's account after the 14 days. This is better than nothing, but much more could be done to ease the path to greater ebook adoption and consumption—for example, allowing owners to rent or resell their digital copies at will.\n\nTwo websites are pursuing an interesting intermediate step, inserting themselves as a cost-free broker between owners of books bought for Amazon's Kindle reader and prospective borrowers. Book Lending set up shop in January (it initially had Kindle in its name but Amazon insisted this be removed). Lendle launched just a few weeks ago. (Barnes & Noble's Nook reader is not supported by either for now.)\n\nBy joining one (or both) of the services, users gain access to an inventory of titles purchased from Amazon's Kindle Store by other members. But each middleman adopts a slightly different approach, in particular with regard to the social contract involved. Book Lender allows any registered user to request available books, and does not throttle requests. Nor does it require reciprocity, though frequent lenders get a boost in the queues for popular books. Lendle takes a different tack. Before anyone can borrow a book, he has to offer to loan at least one other, racking up two borrowing credits in return. \"Lendlers\" found to be accepting requests without fulfilling them will be banned.\n\nContinue reading \"Either a borrower or a lender be\" »",

        "instruction": "When we put Tim Cook on the cover of Fortune two months ago, shining a spotlight on the powerful, behind-the-scenes executive who labors in the shadow of a larger-than-life CEO, we posited that should Cook ever assume the top job from Steve Jobs: “Apple may not suffer from acute Stevelessness as much as the world seems to think.”\n\nOur supposition is about to be put to the test.\n\nNow the world’s eyes are on Cook, from competitors like Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and Microsoft to Apple’s legendary legions of loyal customers. In mid-January, Jobs finally acknowledged what Apple watchers have feared for months: Five years after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, he’s not completely well. As a result, Jobs is taking a six-month medical leave of absence from Apple. In an e-mail message to employees, he said his “health-related issues are more complex” than he’d previously thought. He also said that he’d tapped Cook to “be responsible for Apple’s day-to-day operations,” and that he, Jobs, would weigh in on “major strategic decisions” and remain CEO.\n\nJobs’ every utterance is scrutinized for its true meaning, so here’s what’s interesting about his note, which was very much intended for public consumption: Cook, who is Apple’s chief operating officer, has been running Apple’s daily affairs for years. What has changed, then, is the degree to which Jobs will be involved. In other words, if Apple and Cook—as well as the tech world—are ready for Life AfterSteve, the test phase has begun. It’s even possible that Cook has started his own public audition to be Apple’s permanent chief executive.\n\nUntil recently the world outside of Apple assumed that Cook wasn’t CEO material. Sure, the 48-year-old Alabamian had stepped in for Jobs on an interim basis in 2004 when the Apple co-founder underwent surgery. But the outside perception of Cook was as merely an operations wonk—the guy who makes the trains run on time—not the visionary to replace Jobs should the need arise.\n\nWhat people have come to understand is that Cook has hoovered up so much responsibility at Apple that no one else’s authority—save Jobs’—comes close. “The company already has coalesced around him,” says a top Apple executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. This executive adds that Cook’s mild-mannered, unemotional approach to business actually makes him a welcome relief to dealing with the mercurial Jobs. “Tim does almost nothing that would make you disrespect him, which you can’t always say aboutSteve,” he says.\n\nCook has vastly expanded his horizons in the decade since he joined Apple. When Cook arrived in 1998 from Compaq, Apple was badly bruised. His job was to tidy the company’s messy supply-chain apparatus. He has since taken charge of all operations, sales, customer support, the Macintosh division, the company’s online store, and the important task of managing Apple’s relationships with the phone companies that carry the iPhone. As a board member of Nike, the athletic Cook has enhanced his operational experience with oversight of a world-class marketer from a different industry. Says Jeanne Jackson, a veteran retailer who sits on the boards of McDonald’s and Nordstrom, in addition to Nike: “I think the Apple shareholders are well served by Tim, with their interests in the hands of an intelligent, thoughtful, and disciplined leader.” (For more on Cook’s leadership style, see “The Genius Behind Steve” on Fortune.com.)\n\nThe fear, though, is that Apple has thrived because of the genius of Jobs—thoughtfulness and discipline be damned—and that the company will crumble without him. (The stock slid 14% and lost $12 billion in market value from mid-December, when Jobs triggered investor concerns by canceling his appearance at the annual Macworld conference, to mid-January, when he disclosed his leave.) In fact, Apple insiders say that in recent years Jobs has narrowed his interests to the subjects that truly excite him, including design, advertising, marketing, public events, and key products like the iPhone and iPod—leaving the rest to Cook. And of course Apple has built its own computer operating system, integrated hardware and software, and entered and disrupted entirely new industries like music and telephones. “Those aren’t core competencies that you can go out and buy or organically grow in a reasonable amount of time,” Cook said recently, according to someone who knows him.\n\nJobs is taking a six-month medical leave and putting Tim Cook in charge of daily operations. The test phase of Life After Steve—and Cook’s tryout for the job of Apple CEO—has officially begun.\n\n“They’ve got to clarify who’s in charge,” says Yale management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld. “It’s not good for Tim. It’s not good for Steve. And it is not good for the company.”\n\nIndeed, it is unlikely that Jobs’ absence will have any impact on the company’s near-term plans, given that Apple famously and secretively plots its products years in advance. The iPhone, for example, was at least three years in the making. According to someone familiar with the Apple executive team’s thinking, “major strategic decisions” include big acquisitions, other large outlays of cash, and entirely new product categories. The odds that Jobs hasn’t already signed off on such matters for the next handful of months or so are low. Apple declined to make Jobs or Cook available for comment.\n\nStill, partners and competitors, and even the larger business community, must be contemplating what their worlds will look like without the hugely influential Jobs on the scene. He sits on the board of Walt Disney Co., which acquired his Pixar in 2006, and has become an important advisor to CEO Robert Iger. “He’s the CEO. My job is to help him however I can,” Jobs told Fortune about Iger in mid-December. “I love chatting with him about things.” And Jobs’ perfectionism has left an indelible imprint on the business world. His desire to create a better retail experience, for example, led to the Apple stores, and spawned copycats such as AT&T’s “experience stores.”\n\nEven before the disclosure of Jobs’ leave from the company he co-founded in 1976, the chatter in the Apple blogosphere has been that the company’s innovation had slowed. It’s been two years, after all, since the introduction of the iPhone, Apple’s last revolutionary product. While accurate, it’s a bit of a stretch to suggest Apple’s innovative days are behind it. The company has had three truly game-changing products: the Macintosh in 1984, the iPod in 2001, and the iPhone in 2007. Each upended an established industry. Each arose secretly from scratch in Apple’s design labs.\n\nApple, of course, doesn’t say what it’s working on. That’s why there’s a whole cottage industry that speculates on where Apple will go next. Sanford Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, for example, has identified three areas he thinks could add up to an additional $15 billion in annual revenue: cheaper Macs, iPhones that don’t require their buyers to sign up with an Apple-approved wireless company, and, most significant, a combo DVR/cable box/home-entertainment hub that would be a major improvement over the company’s fledgling AppleTV product. “With its 100-million-strong iPod/iTunes user base, expertise in hardware, software, and content integration, and skill in developing intuitive user interfaces, Apple appears uniquely positioned to deliver a true digital home experience,” Sacconaghi recently wrote in a note to clients. Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, guesses that Apple’s next big projects will be related to new mobile products (“They really like the idea of a ‘computer in your pocket,'” he says) and a major international retail-stores expansion, noting that Apple hasn’t yet graced the French with its presence and has only one store in all of China.\n\nJobs is stepping back at what would have been a difficult time anyway. As Fortune went to press, Apple was due to report earnings on Jan. 21, with investors bracing for weaker Mac and iPhone shipments. Even before Apple reported, signs of distress were visible everywhere in the electronics industry. Hard-drive maker Seagate removed its top executives and slashed its workforce, Apple chip suppliers Intel and Nvidia sharply lowered financial guidance, and a beleaguered Sanyo agreed to sell itself to Panasonic. Researcher IDC recorded a slight year-over-year decline in worldwide fourth-quarter PC shipments, the first such drop in six years.\n\nStill, Apple enters the slowdown in a position of strength, with nearly $25 billion in cash on its balance sheet at the end of September. Investors betting that Apple without Jobs will continue to turn out hits have the opportunity to buy the stock at $83, down from almost $203 in late 2007. A full $27 of that stock price is net cash, estimates UBS analyst Maynard Um.\n\nFor years Apple’s share price has benefited from a “Jobs premium.” The company’s board of directors now has to deal with the fact that investors don’t know quite what to think, especially given the ambiguity of Cook’s position. “They’ve got to clarify who’s in charge,” says Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the noted management professor at Yale. “It’s not good for Tim. It’s not good for Steve. It’s not good for the company.” Sonnenfeld suggests that Jobs should become chairman, what he calls a “legitimate ambassadorial” role that would permit the current CEO more privacy, and that Cook be formally named CEO. Apple’s board has no chairman, which is unusual. Instead, Intuit’s Bill Campbell and Genentech’s Art Levinson (chairmen of their companies’ respective boards) are Apple’s “co-lead” directors, whatever that means. Campbell and Levinson declined to comment for this article.\n\nInterestingly, some of the executives closest to Jobs expect him to return to work, as he says he will. “Six to nine months from now, when he comes back, Tim will have shown what the company can do and that Steve doesn’t have to be involved with every single thing,” says one senior executive, who has worked closely with Jobs and Cook. Another executive says that there’s only one way Jobs can halt the talk about his demise. “All that will change things is for him to gain weight and have an event to announce a fantastic new product,” says this executive, who regularly speaks to and meets with Jobs. As all of us would surely agree, it should only come to pass.\n\nThis article is from the February 2, 2009 issue of Fortune.",

        "instruction": "Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. said it will build a $200 million manufacturing plant on a 12-acre site it has purchased in the southeastern Massachusetts town of Norton, a facility that may employ 220 workers within five years.\n\nChief executive John Maraganore declined to disclose how much Cambridge-based Alnylam paid for the land, acquired Wednesday from Quincy real estate development firm Condyne LLC. Maraganore said in an interview Thursday that Alnylam plans to break ground in April and complete construction of the plant by 2018, when its first drugs are expected to enter the market.\n\nThe production site will initially employ about 150 workers, but is expected to add jobs over time, Maraganore said.\n\n“This will be our facility for potentially dozens of medicines,” Maraganore said. “We’re in execution mode now as a company. To be able to reach our goal of being a multi-product company by 2020, we have to be able to manufacture these important medicines.”\n\nMassachusetts, a global center for drug research, is becoming a force in production as well. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. runs a plant in Devens, Sanofi Genzyme has manufacturing in Boston and Framingham, and Biogen Inc. has a site in Cambridge. Other companies that make drugs here include Pfizer Inc. (Andover), Shire PLC (Lexington), AbbVie Inc. (Worcester), and Baxter International Inc. (Milford).\n\nExpanding drug manufacturing in Massachusetts has become a priority for state officials because the plants often employ more people than research and development sites.\n\n“This is another proof point that we have all the architecture to take drugs from idea to manufacturing,” said Travis McCready, president of the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center, the state agency charged with promoting biotech and medical technology. “Alnylam is a company born in Massachusetts, and it’s exciting to see them continue to grow in scale here.”\n\nThe life sciences center will review an Alnylam application later this month for a tax incentive based on its plans to create jobs at the manufacturing site, McCready said. The town of Norton has approved a 13-year property tax reduction totaling more than $7 million.\n\nAlnylam, a pioneer in the emerging gene-silencing technology known as RNA interference, is not expected to seek US approval for its first drug until next year. But the company has a market value of about $5 billion based on expectations of its pipeline’s potential.\n\nMaraganore said Alnylam is using a small site in Cambridge to produce its lead drug candidate, Patisiran, which treats a rare neurological disease, for clinical trials and, eventually, commercial sales. But the remainder of its drug portfolio, he said, will be made in Norton and at third-party contract manufacturers to assure back-up production capacity.\n\nAlnylam currently has eight experimental drugs in clinical trials, and expects to have 11 by the end of the year. Maraganore said the company projects it will continue to introduce new drugs for clinical testing at a rate of about three a year for the foreseeable future. In some of its drug programs, Alnylam is collaborating with the larger Sanofi Genzyme.\n\nMaraganore said drug production at Norton will use a process called RNA synthesis, which includes advanced purification techniques. While the company looked at a number of other sites, “basing the plant here in Massachusetts was important to us,” he said, citing the need for a highly skilled workforce. “This facility will be more sophisticated than a typical pharmaceutical plant that makes pills.”\n\nAlnylam has about 350 employees globally, including about 325 in Massachusetts.\n\nThe company also has a small office outside London and is planning to open a European headquarters. The drugs made in Norton will be shipped worldwide.\n\nMaraganore said the company expects to have more than 1,500 employees globally in the next five years and plans to continue building a campus in Cambridge’s Kendall Square.\n\nLast year, Alnylam negotiated a “right of first offer” to lease Genzyme Center, the signature office tower in the heart of Kendall Square’s biotechnology cluster, when Sanofi Genzyme moves out in 2018. Alnylam has also agreed to lease offices and labs at 675 West Kendall St., diagonally across from Genzyme Center, starting on May 1, 2018.

He announced this morning on \"Good Morning America\" that he would accept “small contributions,” and he is now telling the Wall Street Journal that he won’t be entirely self-funding his campaign.\n\n“I’ll be putting up money, but won’t be completely self-funding, as I did during the primaries,” Trump told the WSJ.\n\nA campaign official confirmed to ABC News, as first reported by the WSJ, that Trump will tap into his vast personal Rolodex to shore up his campaign so that it will be able to compete in a general election.\n\nThe official went on to say that the campaign will likely operate on a business model that is less expensive than traditional campaigns. Trump also announced on NBC that he hopes to raise $1 billion, working in conjunction with the Republican National Committee.\n\nThis reversal is, as Trump would say, “yuuugee.” Trump proudly boasts at almost every campaign event that he is “self funded”.

        "instruction": "FORTUNE — Duolingo, the company and free application that teaches people languages through game-like activities, announced on Tuesday that it raised $20 million in a funding round led by the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.\n\nThe service, which launched in 2012, is now used by 20 million people, 10 million of whom are active. Co-founder and chief executive Luis von Ahn — who teaches computer science at Carnegie Mellon University and also happened to co-invent the reCAPTCHA anti-bot tool — said there is one goal for Duolingo: To provide free language education to virtually everyone.\n\nVon Ahn said the new injection of funds will be used for product development, not promotion. “We don’t advertise. I’m a pretty strong believer that our product should speak for itself,” he said. In 2013, Duolingo was Apple’s App Store choice for “App of the Year.” It’s also a top Android app in the Google Play store. Just one week ago, Duolingo won the award for “Best Education Startup” at TechCrunch’s Crunchie Awards.\n\nVon Ahn, 34, is originally from Guatemala, where access to well-paying jobs is largely dependent on the ability to speak English. Classes and language certification tests, however, can be costly and difficult to get to, especially for individuals who live far from major cities.\n\nMORE: Meet Microsoft’s new (old) head of Lync and Skype\n\nVon Ahn and his co-founder Severin Hacker saw Duolingo as an opportunity to make language education accessible and to indirectly stimulate economic development. Learning another language can help people graduate to the middle class, they say. Though Duolingo’s English-learning courses are its most popular, there are also courses in Spanish, French, Italian, and German, with several others still in development.\n\nFor some jobs, simply saying you’ve learned a language isn’t enough; you may also have to prove your competency with a certification test, most of which run around $250. “In some places, that’s an entire month’s salary,” von Ahn said. In the coming months, Duolingo plans to provide a $20 accredited certification test that can be proctored remotely over a person’s computer, saving the expense of traveling in person for an exam.\n\nThe app teaches vocabulary and grammar in increasingly difficult stages, using a blend of audio and visual matching and translation to teach. People who use the app can compare their scores for the exercises, adding a dose of competition to the mix. “Duolingo won’t be called a game,” von Ahn said, “but we want to make it as fun as a game.”\n\nThe company’s researchers said there is a strong correlation between the app’s gaming methods and users’ retention of new language skills. Indeed, “gamification” is something of a recent buzzword in many business circles. “The more fun and meaningful you can make something, the easier it is to learn,” said Larry Dailey, a professor at the University of Nevada, Reno who teaches a course in serious game design, a field that uses games to train or educate people rather than only entertain. “For example, why do cats chase string? Two reasons. One, it’s fun. And two, it helps them develop skills to catch mice later. Games can be extraordinary tools for learning.”\n\nMORE: The NBA scores with new technology and video games\n\nKleiner Perkins partner Bing Gordon said that he has had an interest in the reinvention of education for some time. KPCB has invested in the companies Coursera, Codecademy, and Remind101. “Duolingo has the pole position to be a thought leader and a market leader,” Gordon said. “They’re the missionaries of a good cause.”\n\nDuolingo is not yet profitable, but von Ahn is not concerned. “We made the decision that our immediate goal is not to be profitable,” he said. “It’s to be the best de facto product for language learning.” Still, the company has found an innovative way to bring in money that doesn’t involve display advertising. Like reCAPTCHA, for which people retype words scanned from printed documents as a security check, Duolingo offers to partners such as CNN and BuzzFeed translations of their articles culled from the responses of its learning users. In exchange for top-voted translations, Duolingo makes a few cents per word from its partners.\n\nVon Ahn said he wants Duolingo “to be fun but not a waste of time.” With an additional $20 million on hand, he’ll have lots of time to figure out how best to achieve that goal.",

        "instruction": "'He wasn’t worried: he was used to doing this kind of thing' … Hans Prignitz's handstand on St Michaelis Church, Hamburg, taken in 1948 by Jürgen Schadeberg\n\nHans Prignitz was the brother of a friend of mine. He was an acrobat who, like us, grew up in Berlin during the war. When the war ended, we all moved to Hamburg and Hans started performing in a nightclub. He'd do his whole show upside down, walking on long sticks held in his hands, even going up and down stairs. It was unbelievable.\n\nI took this in 1948 when I was 17 and working as an apprentice with the German Press Agency. I'd gone along to the club to photograph Hans as a favour. In those days, it was difficult to get flashbulbs, so I used a frying pan with flash powder pressed into it. I raised my camera and lit the powder. There was a huge flash – and then screaming. Thick black smoke was swirling around the club. Above me was a balcony full of people: their faces were covered in soot. Naturally, I was thrown out.\n\nI got the shot, though, and was able to make Hans a nice print of his act. In return, I asked him to pose for me on top of St Michaelis church, a famous Hamburg landmark. He was delighted. We climbed up together and he got straight on to his hands. There wasn't much to catch him if he fell, just a little ledge half a metre wide. But he wasn't worried: he was used to doing this kind of thing on sticks, so there was no danger of him losing his balance. He was so secure, so strong and sure of himself.\n\nThe church had survived the war. From its big tower you could see large areas of Hamburg that were still in ruins, either bombed or burnt. It was a typical rainy day. Hamburg has a terrible climate: the rain is particularly cold and it never stops, even in summer.\n\nLife was hard then. As an apprentice, I didn't get paid and would often have nothing to eat. But I was young and having fun, although I did do lots of stupid things. I almost got swept out to sea after photographing Hermann Göring's yacht from a small rowing boat. It was up for auction.\n\nOne day, the agency head called me in and said: \"Now look here, I see you in the canteen but you only drink water. You look so thin.\" I told him I didn't have any money and he said I could photograph weekend football matches. If a picture was used, I'd be paid 20 marks, enough for a meal. It was nice of him, but all that standing in the freezing cold put me off football for life.\n\nWhen I was a child growing up in Berlin, I would say to my mother: \"Who is this man on the radio who is always shouting and seems so angry? What is this all about?\" She told me to be quiet or I would get us into trouble. It was a very unpleasant environment to grow up in and, after the war, a lot of Nazis were still around. The atmosphere was bad. I needed to get away, so went to South Africa. This ended up being like going from the frying pan into the fire, since it was the beginning of apartheid – although no one believed it would last, since fascism had been conquered in Europe.\n\nHans eventually joined the circus and worked all over Europe and the Middle East. He died about a year and a half ago. His daughter came to an exhibition I had in Hamburg recently. This picture was on display. She was so proud of it.\n\nBorn: Berlin, 1931.Studied: \"Briefly at the Berlin Foto and Optic Technology school and by apprenticing.\"Influences: Henri Cartier-Bresson, W Eugene Smith, Sebastião Salgado.High point: \"Photographing Nelson Mandela and black African musicians.\"Low point: \"Apartheid.

        "instruction": "BIRD-IN-HAND, Pa.—William O’Brien, chief loan officer at the Bank of Bird-in-Hand, closed so many loans in the bank’s first year of business that locals call him “Gelt Chappie,” or “money man” in Pennsylvania German.\n\nBased in a rural village in the heart of Amish country, Bank of Bird-in-Hand is the only new bank to open in the U.S. since 2010, when the Dodd-Frank law was passed and enacted. An average of more than 100 new banks a year opened in the three decades before Dodd-Frank.\n\nBankers say the drought is a sign of new regulatory requirements in the wake of the financial crisis, which are boosting expenses and discouraging potential startups from even trying. Regulators say the profit squeeze from rock-bottom interest rates is a bigger problem.\n\n“There was, still is, a pent-up demand for a local bank,” Mr. O’Brien says, describing a local man who manufactures mattresses for dairy cows. Though the mattresses are common in dairy barns, the man told Mr. O’Brien he had trouble getting a loan from a large bank, which didn’t understand the product.\n\n“He never forgot that,” Mr. O’Brien says. “And that gets around.”\n\nBank of Bird-in-Hand caters mainly to the local Amish community, though it welcomes other customers, too. The bank doesn’t offer online banking, but its sole branch does have a drive-through window that can accommodate a horse and buggy.\n\nLancaster County, Pa., has abundant farms and small businesses, but larger banks often aren’t interested in business loans of less than $1 million, says Mr. O’Brien.\n\nHe says loan demand is so high that “if there would have been two of me, we could have done more” than the $60 million in loans made in the first year after Bank of Bird-in-Hand opened its doors in late 2013.\n\nLast year, the more than 6,000 locally focused “community banks” in the U.S. increased their combined earnings by 9.1% from 2013, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The overall U.S. banking industry suffered a profit decline because of problems at the biggest firms.\n\nA Federal Reserve study concluded that the number of bank startups has historically tracked the Fed’s interest-rate policy, suggesting that higher rates might encourage investors to start a new crop of banks.\n\nEarlier this month, regulators gave conditional approval for the second postcrisis bank, Primary Bank of New Hampshire.\n\nLawmakers are concerned about the dearth of new banks because small banks make the majority of farm and small-business loans, federal data show.\n\n“There are many on both sides of the aisle that believe improvements [to rules impacting small banks] can and should be made,” Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R., Ala.) said earlier this year.\n\nLow interest rates are especially painful for small banks because they rely on interest income more than big banks do.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Bank of Bird-in-Hand had a net interest margin of 1.38%, far below 3.63% for community banks overall, as it altered loan and deposit rates to seek out new customers. Net interest margin is the gap between what banks earn on loans and pay for deposits.\n\nThe new bank posted a loss of about $1.4 million in 2014, hurt by reserves set aside to cover future loan losses. Experts say profits aren’t expected right away at startup banks.\n\nLike other banks, Bank of Bird-in-Hand has had to hire compliance experts, buy new computer systems and spend more time writing policies and regulatory reports. One of its 16 employees is dedicated full-time to regulatory compliance, despite Mr. O’Brien’s desire to hire another loan officer.\n\nLast fall, the management team spent more than a month preparing for its first annual exam, a three-week visit from a team of about 10 FDIC and state examiners, who visited in shifts.\n\nThe examiners looked at hardware and software systems geared toward meeting regulatory requirements for loan reviews, information technology, anti-money-laundering controls and treatment of low-income borrowers, among other areas.\n\nThe bank paid for “white hat” hackers to test its cyber-security infrastructure and hired a consultant to test the bank’s sensitivity to interest rates.\n\nChief Executive Alan Dakey says the examiners “obviously want to see us be successful, and the attitude is constructive in their approach.”\n\nThe bank’s early success suggests there is a place for small lenders, but it is also in a position others would struggle to replicate.

It is a means of achieving the “lowest possible price, and highest possible reliability,” Holden explained.\n\nLast year, Uber unveiled a partnership with Carnegie Mellon University as well as a research and development center in Pittsburgh to work on driverless car technology. Uber is also working with the University of Arizona’s College of Optical Science on optics technology for mapping and safety features that are critical to autonomous vehicles.\n\nHowever, the company’s relationship with Carnegie Mellon has since cooled, according to the university. Uber is mostly working at its tech center alone, along with some of the robotics experts it poached from the university.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nSo is Uber racing to be the absolute first to build driverless cars?\n\nNot necessarily, according to Holden. “It’s important to be not last,” he said. The true obstacle to success would be if a competitor not only built driverless cars first, but was also able to deploy them on a large scale and thereby capture much of the market.\n\nThat’s likely also why Uber has opted to work on as much of the technology itself as possible instead of outsourcing it to partners, as rival Lyft has chosen to do through its alliance and $500 million investment from General Motors earlier this year.\n\nAlthough Uber’s driverless car ambitions have only been public for about a year, Holden revealed that it’s something the company has been thinking about for quite a while. “It goes back to when I started and [CEO Travis Kalanick] and I were brainstorming about the future,” said Holden, who joined Uber in March 2014.\n\nNevertheless, the race for driverless cars is becoming tighter, and while most experts say we won’t see any of these cars in a commercial capacity until about 2020, Holden says they will be on the road sooner than most people think.\n\n“I think you’re going to start seeing activity on the road this year from multiple players” he hinted, though he also added that widespread use of these cars is indeed a few year away. And he may be right—less than a month ago, Uber started to test its self-driving car technology in Pittsburgh.",

        "instruction": "A landmark decision by the federal court to award more than $3.3m in compensation to the traditional owners of land around Timber Creek could pave the way for billions of dollars in liability payouts by states, territories, and the resource sector, experts have said.\n\nThe Ngaliwurru and Nungali groups won compensation on Wednesday for a number of acts carried out by government on land over which they later gained native title. The acts, including the construction of public works, extinguished native title on some areas and affected the ability of the traditional owner groups to conduct spiritual and ceremonial activities.\n\nRetiring federal court judge John Mansfield ordered compensation of $3,300,261, including $512,000 for the economic value of the extinguished rights, more than $1.48m in interest, and another $1.3m for pain and suffering.\n\nGavin Scott, a partner at Ashurt law firm specialising in native title, said the quantification of monetary compensation for hurt, loss of spiritual connection and attachment to the land had never really been ventilated properly in a native title perspective before.\n\nHe said based on the $3.3m Timber Creek decision, which related to a block of land just 23 sq km, the potential for future payouts across the more than 23m sq km of native title land was huge.\n\n“The states and territories are liable for that compensation under the Native Title Act, but the hook for industry – for people with projects in areas where native title has been determined, people looking to do new projects – the hook there is what will the state do there to address that risk and that potential compensation liability?”\n\nHe said the commonwealth had always included potential compensation in its line items in budgets, but would now likely be looking at agreements with resource companies and others to operate on native title land.\n\n“What you will see, similarly to New South Wales recently and in WA, is legislative change to things like mining legislation which says any compensation which may be proven or payable for native title is now to be paid by the person granted by the mining lease. So that’s the government taking active steps to pass that on.”\n\nScott said it could also pass on the responsibility contractually.\n\nWhile the Timber Creek case set a precedent for methodology, it wasn’t a “cookie-cutter approach”.\n\n“Each group has different interpretations of their native title rights and interests. The activities of states and territories will be different as well,” he said.\n\nThe case could also still be appealed.\n\nHe said another consideration was the accumulating potential interest. More than $1.48m of the Timber Creek payment was interest on the acts which were carried out in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nNative title determinations and compensation claims are still progressing through the courts, but Scott said the federal court was making good progress in pushing resolutions.\n\n“Once that happens there is still a lot of work to do to prove compensation and to value it,” he said.",

        "instruction": "Across the country, thousands of people are desperate for accessible and affordable healthcare. For far too many of them, their only option—even for non-emergency care—is a $1,500 visit to the emergency room.\n\nFor example, 200 counties in Texas are considered medically underserved with 16 counties having just one primary care doctor and 27 counties having none. These citizens have nowhere to turn.\n\nThe good news is that a solution exists. It is called telehealth and has been increasing in use across the country over the last decade. However, a decision last month by the Texas State Medical Board will sharply restrict access for Texans by requiring in-person visits before you are allowed to use telemedicine. Previously, the board required doctors to establish a relationship with patients before giving a diagnosis or prescribing drugs, but its April 10 decision narrowed rules to state that “questions and answers exchanged through email, electronic text, or chat or telephonic evaluation or consultation with a patient” are not enough to establish a doctor-patient relationship.\n\nThat is a step in the wrong direction. Telehealth is a proven option to deliver quality, non-emergency care when a primary care doctor is not available or for the many Americans who have not yet established a primary care provider (PCP) because of a lack of availability or waiting times. It allows a patient to have a telephonic or videoconference with a doctor in lieu of an in-person visit when appropriate to facilitate comparable diagnosis and treatment. Using the tool of telemedicine, providers can remotely examine patients, reference medical records, and prescribe appropriate medication.\n\nTelehealth does not replace the need for a primary care doctor, but serves as a complementary convenient and cost-effective alternative to an office visit when circumstances or geography warrant. For Americans living in medically-underserved areas, it can prevent a patient from ignoring what is now a minor issue, but might be an emergency later, for lack of access or transportation.\n\nAcross the country, 49 states now allow video and phone conference consults. In Texas alone hundreds of employers provide telehealth to more than 3 million employees when seeing their doctor isn’t necessary for common health problems. This practice has existed for over a decade and companies specializing in telemedicine have demonstrated excellent patient satisfaction and outcomes.\n\nGiven these benefits and safety profile, what is behind the Texas Medical Board’s ruling?\n\nAs a physician who has worked in medicine for 42 years, I can attest that one of the most exciting and simultaneously terrifying constants in medicine is change. Just a few years out of training, physicians learn new evidence, improved protocols, and better methods that they must master. A successful career in medicine requires adapting to and embracing change.\n\nIn the case of telemedicine, it is a monumental change. We are taught as physicians to lay hands on patients – touch them, examine them, listen to them, see them. The idea of separating the visit and the exam from care is a fundamental reversal of what we learn when we first put on the white coat and don the stethoscope.\n\nBut we must remember that telemedicine is not the practice of medicine, but a tool for the delivery of care. And it’s a tool with a proven track record and support in the medical community.\n\nIn Texas, the Medical Board received 203 comment letters from physicians and other interested parties affected by the rule change; only four spoke out against telemedicine. For specific concerns—such as prescribing practices—these elements that can be addressed and regulated without stopping the use of telemedicine altogether.\n\nThe question, as I see it, is whether a physician who has met a patient once for 15 minutes is better equipped to safely diagnose and treat a non-emergent issue on a weekend than a provider who practices via telemedicine regularly and is trained in the delivery of remote care.\n\nFinally, we have to remember that the way we pay for healthcare – the fee-for-service model – is going away. We are moving to value-based-care, a model where outcomes and efficiencies are rewarded, not volume. Trying to preserve fee-for-service medicine by stymieing innovative business models will prove fruitless.\n\nWe call it practicing medicine for a reason. It is a constantly-evolving application of principles and judgment to do what is best in a series of patterned but ultimately unique interactions. As physicians, we get up every day unsure of what is to come, but knowing we must use the tools we have to do what is best for our patients. Telemedicine is a tool that in many instances is best for the patient, and in some cases is the only option for a patient.\n\nIt is time to do what is best for the patient and the healthcare economy and get online with telemedicine.\n\nBill Frist is a surgeon, businessman and former two-term U.S. senator representing Tennessee.

        "instruction": "Siding with Democrats on issues like filling the Supreme Court vacancy seems only to have alienated Mr. Kirk’s Republican core voters, while gaining him little affection elsewhere. Mr. Kirk represents a strain of moderate Republicanism long popular in Illinois, but increasingly seen as out of step as his party has marched to the right.\n\nMike Grajewski, a registered Republican who owns a Chicago diner called Uncle Mike’s Place, went through a list of issues that Mr. Kirk had switched his position on. “He’s a Republican,” Mr. Grajewski said. “He’s pandering.”\n\nMr. Kirk’s votes in alliance with Democrats, and his liberal positions on numerous issues, particularly his support for same-sex marriage and for abortion rights, have left many Illinois Republicans feeling betrayed.\n\nThat has left Mr. Kirk trying to promote his willingness to cross the aisle, while Democrats highlight his allegiance to Republican leaders.\n\n“He has voted with the Democrats every doggone time, so how in the world is he a Republican? That’s what I ask,” said Jim Fisher, 58, of Hudson, Ill., who is active with the McLean County Tea Party and the local Republican Party and who went to the Republican convention as a delegate for Senator Ted Cruz.\n\nMr. Fisher, who works for an insurance company and lives on a farm, said he believed that Republicans, including Mr. Kirk, could win in Illinois by sticking to their values. And he noted that McLean County voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 after supporting Barack Obama in 2008.\n\n“If you want to be a Republican, Mark, be a Republican,” Mr. Fisher said, adding that he thought Mr. Kirk’s pursuit of votes had taken him too far left. “You support pro-choice; you support gay marriage; you support everything that the Republican Party at least in the state of Illinois is against. I don’t see how you can call yourself a Republican.”\n\nMr. Kirk is also not generating much financial support. Ms. Duckworth has raised substantially more money for her campaign than Mr. Kirk — $5.5 million cash on hand compared with his $3.1 million as of June 30 — and the national Republican Party seems reluctant to spend money in Illinois given needs in swing states like Ohio, New Hampshire and Florida.\n\nMr. Kirk, who won election in 2010, faces a particularly tough road. In January 2012, he suffered a severe stroke that required several surgeries and sidelined him for a year of rehabilitation. He mostly gets around the Capitol now in a wheelchair, although he can walk with a cane.\n\nThe Illinois contest is the first time that two candidates who mostly use wheelchairs are battling for a Senate seat, and the inevitable focus on that aspect of the race seems overwhelmingly to Ms. Duckworth’s advantage.\n\nMr. Kirk’s illness, by his own admission, has slowed him down — his speech still occasionally halting and his left side still partly paralyzed, limiting the aggressiveness of his campaigning.\n\nMs. Duckworth, by contrast, has embraced her status as a symbol of the country’s wounded warriors, and as an example that it is possible to return to a full life after grievous injuries.\n\nIn November 2014, shortly after being elected to her second House term in a suburban Chicago district, she gave birth to her first child, a daughter. Ms. Duckworth, who lost her first race for Congress in 2006, is a fierce campaigner, crisscrossing the state and switching easily between using her wheelchair and walking with prosthetic legs and a cane.\n\nMs. Duckworth, 48, was born in Thailand and grew up mostly in Southeast Asia, where her father, a Vietnam War veteran, worked for the United Nations and international companies. She tells voters that members of her family have served in the United States military dating back to the Revolutionary War. Her husband, Bryan W. Bowlsbey, also served in the Iraq war.\n\nBut Ms. Duckworth’s own use of a wheelchair has also allowed her to criticize Mr. Kirk, 56, without fear of being cast as insensitive or unsympathetic.\n\n“I’ve been out on the campaign trail, talking to folks across the state, and everywhere I go people are like, ‘Oh, he has not been here,’ ” Ms. Duckworth said at a campaign stop in Yorkville, Ill., where she met with corn farmers. She added, “If you want to be senator, you need to get around the state and you need to travel and serve the people.”\n\nMs. Duckworth is also doing her best to link Mr. Kirk to Mr. Trump, despite his disavowal of the Republican presidential nominee.\n\n“He supported Trump when he said that all Mexicans were rapists; he supported Trump when he called women pigs and dogs,” Ms. Duckworth said. “He’s just as extreme in his own personal rhetoric.”\n\nShe won at least one convert in Dave Schlapp, 56, a registered Republican. “After seeing her in person and listening to her talk, I’m with her,” he said. “She has common sense.”\n\nMr. Kirk’s efforts to distance himself from other Republicans began even before he pulled his endorsement of Mr. Trump. After the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Mr. Kirk was the first Republican senator to urge a vote on Mr. Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick B. Garland.\n\nAt a meeting last month with Republican senators at the Capitol, Mr. Trump lashed out at Mr. Kirk — who pointedly did not attend — for rescinding his endorsement. According to senators who attended, Mr. Trump called Mr. Kirk “dishonest” and a “loser.”\n\nMr. Kirk has also hit back. He skipped the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, and when a Chicago reporter asked him, “What the hell has happened to your Grand Old Party,” he responded, “They are guilty of plagiarism” — a reference to the speech by Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania.\n\nTo drive home his lack of interest in the convention, Mr. Kirk held governmental events throughout that week in Chicago, including news conferences in his office on his efforts to fight the nation’s opioid addiction epidemic and in immigration law.\n\n“The reason why I am not in Cleveland right now is to do exactly events like this, where I am working with real constituents,” Mr. Kirk said.\n\nEven if Mr. Kirk benefits from his opposition to Mr. Trump, Mr. Durbin said he could not escape his alliance with the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\n\n“The difficulty is once you have voted for Mitch McConnell to lead the Senate, there are certain things that are inevitable,” Mr. Durbin said. “He will hold up the Supreme Court justice, he will not fund these programs that need to be funded, like opioids or Zika. And that is just what it means to vote for a Republican leader these days.”\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the type of helicopter Representative Tammy Duckworth was piloting when she lost her legs in Iraq. It was a Black Hawk, not an Apache.",

        "instruction": "'Captain America' boasts a hero-sized $4 million budget.\n\nIT'S going to be a big one, if everything works\n\nout as befits a musical named ''Captain\n\nAmerica.'' Big, in this case, means a budget\n\nof $4 million - a lot of money, even for a superhero fighting for the American dream, the flag and the woman he loves.\n\nThe superhero will not, in fact, be particularly super when the curtain goes up. The book by Mel Mandel and Norman Sachs (who are also responsible for music and lyrics) has Captain A. going through a mid-life crisis. Fortunately, the action speeds up - his girlfriend, a candidate for President, is captured by terrorists and held hostage at the Lincoln Memorial. That's enough of the plot - when you invest millions, as are Shari Upbin, James Galton and Marvel Comics and some as yet untapped sources, you're entitled to a few secrets.\n\nThe plan is to take the production, which will be directed by Philip Rose, out of town this fall and to Broadway toward year's end. John Cullum, Ken Howard, Richard Kiley and Hal Linden are the names being mentioned for our hero, and Linda Lavin and Cloris Leachman are being talked about to play the woman who is obviously going to be rescued from those baddies.\n\nAnother bit of nice news - and a possible successor to ''Fiddler on the Roof.'' M-Square Entertainment with William S. Hack have obtained the rights to Chaim Potok's ''Chosen,'' and Mr. Potok has agreed to write the book for the musical. The budget, some $4.5 million, is apparently assured and the producers are thinking in terms of Hal Linden (a popular man this week), Topol, Robby Benson or Barry Miller. Broadway by June 1986 is the aim.\n\nHow about Jeanne Moreau in Tennessee Williams's ''Night of the Iguana''? The thought occurred to the producers Fred Walker and Michael Lonergan and that's why the play, with the French star, is scheduled to open on Broadway this fall. Arthur Sherman, who received a Tony nomination for ''The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial,'' will direct.\n\nAnother familiar name will be with us next month. Glynis Johns will co-star with Milo O'Shea in ''The Return of Herbert Bracewell,'' by Andrew Johns. The production, to be directed by Geraldine Fitzgerald, opens May 14 at the Chelsea Playhouse, 519 West 23d Street (243-0992).\n\nOne of the things Jim Dale likes best about the theater is its immediacy and what might be called its ephemeral quality.\n\n''We only exist in people's memories,'' said Mr. Dale, who is currently co-starring in ''A Day in the Death of Joe Egg,'' which opened on Broadway last week after a successful Off Broadway run earlier this year. ''We don't exist on film or tape and we can't be played back. What happens tonight will never happen again.''\n\nActors are ''on the line - naked'' when they appear on stage, he said, and although this can be daunting, ''that's what it is - we love it or we wouldn't do it.''\n\n''You rehearse and listen to the director but finally, in the end, you're out there on your own,'' the 49-year-old actor said. ''Your performance isn't being edited or added to by soundtracks, as in films.''\n\nMr. Dale is, he said, ''a great believer'' in Off Broadway theater.\n\n''There are plays written which only a certain number of people will appreciate but they should be allowed to go on,'' he said. ''I think every actor should go Off Broadway. One needs to have somewhere to go to learn, and if necessary, to make mistakes. You learn from mistakes and failures, not from success.''\n\nMr. Dale said that he had long since accepted the fact that an actor's life was made up of temporary jobs and that he had come to the conclusion that it wasn't at all bad.\n\n''You can only accept another job if you're out of work, or will be,'' he said.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw, John Malkovich, Kevin Kline and Raul Julia - not a trifling combination, or at least such is the belief of Circle in the Square. Shaw is responsible for ''Arms and the Man,'' Mr. Malkovich will direct it, and Mr. Kline and Mr. Julia are to star in the production, which will begin May 9. The comedy - which will also feature Glenne Headly, Mr. Malkovich's wife - is set in 19th-century Bulgaria and will replace ''Orpheus Descending,'' which has been postponed.\n\nA young woman walks away from an unhappy marriage, returns to what she expects will be the comfort of her family and discovers that her mother is also unhappy and moving out on her own, That doesn't sound like a comedy, but in the hands of the playwright Sallie Bingham, we're assured that it is. It can be checked out starting Thursday when the Women's Project presents ''Paducah'' at the American Place Theater, 111 West 46th Street. Tammy Grimes and Carrie Nye are starring, and Joan Vail Thorne directing.\n\nCan it be possible that there will be marquees around the city reading ''Sit Down and Eat Before Our Love Gets Cold,'' ''Bruce Lee Is Dead and I'm Not Feeling Too Good Either'' and ''Tinned Lettuce''? Believe it. ''Tinned Lettuce,'' a musical parody written and designed by Edward Gorey, will be at the New York University Main Stage Two, 725 Broadway near Waverly Place (598-2091), April 17-27. Matt Williams's ''Bruce Lee'' opens April 23 at the Riverwest Theater, 155 Bank Street (243-0259). ''Sit Down,'' written by Barbara Schottenfeld, who also has the lead role, will begin previews April 18 at the American Kaleidoscope Theater, 5 West 63d Street (279-4200).\n\nG.I.'s in World War II referred to the mined areas in the African desert as ''Rommel's Garden,'' and that's the name of the play by Harvey Gabor that will open at the Harold Clurman Theater May 8. Lonny Price will play a wiseguy private and Jack Garfein will direct. The theater is at 412 West 42d Street.\n\nStart saving up for it now. Mike Nichols, Elaine May and Joan Rivers are among the personalities who will appear in ''Comic Relief,'' an entertainment to be presented May 19 by Lorne Michaels at the Shubert Theater to benefit the AIDS Medical Foundation. Co-chairmen are Joseph Papp, Bernard B. Jacobs and Gerald Schoenfeld. Tickets start at $100, and for $250 or $500, a party in Shubert Alley will be thrown in. Information: 949-7410.\n\nA revue-style entertainment, celebrating the story-songs of Harry Chapin, who was killed in an automobile accident in 1981, begins previews next Friday at the Village Gate (Downstairs), 160 Bleecker Street. ''Lies and Legends, the Musical Stories of Harry Chapin'' is budgeted at $400,000, directed by Sam Weisman and has a cast that includes Martin Vidnovic, Terri Klausner and Ron Orbach.

Big, in this case, means a budget   of $4 million - a lot of money, even for a superhero fighting for the American dream, the flag and the woman he loves.   The superhero will not, in fact, be particularly super when the curtain goes up. The book by Mel Mandel and Norman Sachs (who are also responsible for music and lyrics) has Captain A. going through a mid-life crisis. Fortunately, the action speeds up - his girlfriend, a candidate for President, is captured by terrorists and held hostage at the Lincoln Memorial. That's enough of the plot - when you invest millions, as are Shari Upbin, James Galton and Marvel Comics and some as yet untapped sources, you're entitled to a few secrets."

But the designer is said to be so besotted with Her Madgesty now that she's ready to pay a fortune to have her model Versace's spring collection.\n\nDonatella proposed that Madonna star in her ad campaign last month at a Versace perfume launch in London. The early word was that Madonna might pose as a favor.\n\nBut Madonna is apparently aware that, though the house of Versace has been struggling financially, it's still not a charity. Which is why, according to one insider, the Material One held out for $12 million.\n\nThat price could include TV as well as print ads. There's also talk of Madonna collaborating on a fashion line.\n\nMadonna's rep confirmed that talks are underway.\n\nThe photo spread is due to be shot at the end of this month by Mario Testino.\n\n\"Madonna is coming up with ideas for the campaign,\" says a source. \"She wants the ads to be provocative and sexy. She wants everyone to know how good she looks at 46.\"\n\nEminem's handlers insist he wasn't lip- synching on \"Saturday Night Live\" last weekend, seven days after Ashlee Simpson's fakery on the same stage.\n\nSlim Shady rep Dennis Dennehy tells us \"he was rapping live\" over \"a backing track of his own vocals. It's hip hop. Artists sample their own voices all time.\"\n\nAll the same, some say \"SNL\" producer Lorne Michaels, whose cast lampooned Simpson's gaffe repeatedly, was mortified the audience heard Eminem's voice when his lips weren't moving.\n\nAn \"SNL\" rep says, \"Lorne was happy Eminem came back for a third time.\"\n\nLast W-ord from Left Coast\n\nAs voters head to the polls, Hollywood Democrats aren't letting up on their Bush-bashing\n\nChristie Brinkley, just back from stumping for Kerry in Pennsylvania, tells us: \"I only know two women who are voting for Bush, and they're both rich.\"\n\nOliver Stone says they didn't need to remake \"The Manchurian Candidate\" - it's been playing for four years in the White House. \"Young Bush is like the Laurence Harvey figure,\" he tells Esquire. \"Brainwashed. He has a vacancy in his eyes.\"\n\n\"I'm going to wait for his impeachment,\" says Susan Sarandon.\n\nParty police at Heidi Klum's Halloween party at Marquee cleared\n\nout the men's bathroom to make for Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. The \"Simple Life\" stars didn't want to wait in line at the ladies' room.\n\nCuriously, though, the pair felt compelled to share one stall, claims a\n\nspy who was slow to vacate the loo. (While they were in there, a spy reports, another party girl wandered into the bathroom and snatched the makeup bag Hilton had left on the counter.)\n\nOver at NA, 25 guys wearing cop uniforms showed up at model Maggie Rizer's Halloween party. As it turned out, they really were cops! Too bad they were at the wrong address. The officers, who had come to raid the nearby Hunk-Mania all-male revue, apologized as they left, even stopping to shake hands with with Kiss front man Gene Simmons.\n\nSean (P. Diddy) Combs, dressed as a Roman gladiator, jumped on top of his car to herald his triumphal arrival at Mariah Carey's party at Cain. The Emperor Combs immediately got into a sword fight with a publicist, who used his Prada bag as a shield.\n\nTobey's an ace on a roll\n\nTobey Maguire has a hot hand - and very droopy eyelids. The \"Spider-Man\" star was the big winner at the all-night Phil Hellmuth Invitational Poker tourney at the Hollywood Park & Casino last week. The actor, who wore sunglasses and a baseball cap, sipped green tea and Coke to stay awake during the game, which started in the early evening and broke up at 8:45 a.m.\n\nMaguire, who outlasted 123 other players (including Danny Masterson of \"That '70s Show\"), turned his $2,000 buy-in into first-place winnings of $95,480.\n\nNew law man in town?\n\nWhoever wins the White House, we're probably due for a new U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. We hear that Attorney General John Ashcroft is looking for a replacement for David Kelley, who inherited the star Justice job from James Comey last year.\n\nAmong those who've been interviewed, say sources, is lawyer-turned-P.I. Bart Schwartz, who worked for Rudy Giuliani when he was U.S. Attorney. If Bush stays in office, Gov. Pataki will have a big voice in who gets the job. If Sen. John Kerry wins, Justice will take its cue from Sen. Chuck Schumer.\n\nARE RUSH Limbaugh and CNN's Daryn Kagan talking marriage? According to U.S. News & World Report, friends of the couple say Kagan could become the fourth Mrs. Limbaugh as soon as the divorce from his third wife, Marta, comes through.

        "instruction": "Moved from a small village in Tuscany two years ago to work in a pizza restaurant in Stroud, Gloucestershire\n\n“I know the boss from before because his family comes from the same village in Lucca that I’m from,” says Livrini.\n\nAlthough his friends and family in Italy do not discuss the vote in the UK, Livrini found that it was a popular topic of conversation on a recent visit to Hungary and France.\n\n“A lot of people talked to me because they knew I worked in England and they asked me what was going on, what do you think about it, is it a problem for you because you are from Italy?” he says. “To be honest, I think it is better for England if they [the UK] go out of Europe. For me it is strange to say this because I am from Italy, but I’m always honest, I always say what I think.\n\n“There are a lot of people coming from the east, which is OK, but if you don’t work you must go back to your country. Where I live in Italy is a small village, but the problem with immigration has started there as well. The Italian government could use the money for people from Italy. It’s the same here. The government in England pays money for these people when they could help people from England.”\n\n“If I was in Italy and they had a vote to stay in Europe or to go out, for sure I would say to go out because of immigration. I’m not a racist. If people are coming here that’s fine, but they need to work.” DG\n\nOrignally from Ostrava, Czech Republic. Moved to Banbury in Oxfordshire in 2009, and in 2013 set up her own company, Distinct Estate Agents\n\n“Before I came here I had a pretty senior position in the Czech Republic but I always wanted to travel,” Naivertová explains. “I wanted to improve my English and then go to Italy but I just fell in love with England. I became a much more cosmopolitan and open-minded person.”\n\nNaivertová was brought up under communism until the age of 13 and says that the Czech Republic is still “restricted to certain thinking”.\n\n“When I came to Britain, my world view changed, how I perceive people. I developed a huge respect for every culture, race and nationality. What I really like about Britain is that you can pretty much do anything. Even if you’re 35 and want to do something completely different in your life, no one will look at you like you’re bonkers.”\n\nShe became a British citizen in 2013 and feels that life has become a bit harder here. “People work more and more and life has become more stressful. There’s more pressure on people.”\n\nHowever, she feels the referendum is focusing the debate in the wrong direction. “I am an immigrant to this country but I do believe immigration should be controlled,” she says. “If I was living in the Czech Republic or China I would still think immigration should be controlled. That’s my very strong belief. But the politicians are focusing on immigration in a very negative way. They should be focusing on the issues about in and out, the advantages and disadvantages.”\n\nShe says she doesn’t think people treat her differently for being a migrant, but that may be because she lives “in a very good part of England which is very cosmopolitan”.\n\n“I adopted this country as my own, and if you go somewhere as an expat it’s up to you to make an effort and make something out of this country,” she says. “I was spat at 12 years ago when I came here, but recently I’ve never had problems. The funniest thing is I went to Wales once and they said to me ‘You’re a very nice person, why are you living in England?’”JT\n\nFrom Amritsar in north-west India. Went to the London School of Economics to study an MBA, then moved to Newcastle where he works as the manager of a betting shop\n\n“In the industry I work in, I deal with people from all backgrounds,” says Malhotra. “I think people are worried when they see a lot of immigrants coming to the UK. They relate immigration to everyday problems, like delays in getting doctor’s appointments and lack of housing. They don’t mention it directly to me, but when you have a discussion they aren’t happy with the amount of people coming to the UK. Immigration is the main reason I’ve heard for those wanting to leave the EU.”\n\nMalhotra says he encountered racial abuse a couple of times in London, which he used to find frustrating and upsetting. “Now I don’t notice it so much,” he says. “If one person says you don’t belong here, I don’t think it’s a battle worth having. I ignore them and move on. Most people are friendly and have accepted me.”\n\nHe says he now sees more people in the UK from abroad, but doesn’t view this as a negative thing.\n\n“Greater diversity brings much more talent and skills – this is a huge benefit to the country and the economy. When people talk about immigration, they don’t talk about this – the doctors, engineers, scientists, hard-working people running their businesses, or even people working in shops.\n\n“The focus is the strain on the NHS, more people claiming benefits rather than people working, paying their taxes and helping to grow the economy.”\n\nMalhotra voted via postal vote last week . “I voted to remain in the EU. If we leave, we’ll be competing with countries like India, China and America in terms of trade. Risks like rising inflation, trade deficit, weaker currency, higher interest rates etc can have greater impact on the UK.\n\n“There would be short-term benefits of leaving the EU, but the benefits of remaining are far greater.” JT\n\nFrom Skopje in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, and is also ethnically Romany. He moved to London in 2005 and works as a university lecturer\n\n“Arriving in London I had a cultural shock – I was shocked by the freedom of, let’s say, the homosexuals to show who they really are,” says Demirovski. “I was positively impressed by the ability of people to express their complex identity.”\n\nAlthough Demirovski has indefinite leave to remain, he is not yet a British citizen and so cannot vote in the EU referendum.\n\n“But if I did have a vote, I’d vote Remain,” he says. “We had all these arguments about free trade and growth, but on a human level I think integration is important. We should have a place where we can keep our diversities and differences but learn to live with each other.”\n\nHe believes immigration has hijacked the debate around whether to leave the EU or not.\n\n“The idea is first come, first served,” he says. “That the ones arriving early in a country have more rights than later migrants. If you look at Nigel Farage, his family came in the 19th century but he believes he now has more rights than the ones who arrived 50 years ago, or 10 years ago, or today. That’s wrong.”\n\nDemirovski says his experience over the last 11 years is that people’s sentiment about migration has changed.\n\n“You go on the trains and buses and people start chatting to you about the referendum and the debate on immigration and ask details. People are curious to find out more. That’s the positive element. But the referendum and the whole issue about immigration is like Pandora’s box – all-giving but contains all the evils of the world. I’m afraid in British society that we are yet to face all the evils.” JT\n\nTwo women from eastern Europe , who have made Glasgow their home. They share similar views of the warmth of Scotland’s welcome, but see the referendum differently\n\nMerelin Melesk from Estonia is enjoying a second stay in Glasgow, having lived here five years ago before travelling through Europe and Australia. She works as an assistant in a coffee shop and volunteers for the RSPB, which she hopes will help in her studies in environmental management.\n\nKatarzyna Jaroch-Wychorska, from Poland, has lived in Glasgow for 10 years and is a support worker. They were helped to settle and find work in Scotland through the Bridges Programmes, a charity which helps immigrants, refugees and asylum-seekers integrate and find work in the country.\n\nThey both talk of their love for Glasgow. “I love this city,” says Jaroch-Wychorska. “It’s been a great experience for me and I am so grateful how much help I’ve had to settle from the government.”\n\nMelesk agrees. “Scottish people are so friendly and have always been warm and helpful. Even when I have travelled in other countries like Italy or Australia, I have always met Scottish people and they are always the friendliest.”\n\nYet, while Jaroch-Wychorska is fearful about the outcome of the EU referendum, Melesk is a little more relaxed. Jaroch-Wychorska is unsure of what her status will be if Britain votes to leave the European Union. “At the moment, we are European citizens, but how would we be regarded if Britain leaves Europe,” she asks.\n\nMelesk, though, is unfazed. “Look,” she says, “I am not fleeing persecution in Estonia, nor did I come to Scotland for financial reasons. I felt that what Scotland offered would help me to achieve my aim of having a career in environmental management.\n\n“If Britain votes to leave the European Union, then so be it. And if I must return to Estonia, then that’s OK.” KM\n\nNakamura is from Nara in Japan. She left at the age of 16 to go to the Leipzig Opera Ballet, then came to the UK in 2011. She lives in Ashford with her boyfriend, Fourmi, another dancer with the Jasmin Vardimon Company. He is from Le Mans in France\n\nNakamura thinks the attitude towards immigrants is more problematic in Ashford than in London, where she lived previously. “London was particularly open to immigrants or anyone from other cultures, but we have experienced some mean attitudes towards immigrants [in Ashford]. Small things, but sometimes I think, is it is because I am an immigrant that you are doing this?” she says.\n\nShe believes life will get harder for migrants in the UK, whichever way the vote goes later this week. She pays £600 a year for a visa to remain in the UK and £150 a year to access the NHS. “When I pay for my visa, I almost have nothing left that month. I’m sure it will get more strict.”\n\nFourmi feels that much of the debate during the referendum has been about immigration. “It is the same in France. Constantly you talk about immigration. People are scared and I understand that, but I think they shouldn’t be,” he says.\n\nHe says he recently found himself at the receiving end of some vitriol about his nationality. “I was renting a car and somehow I might have jumped the queue, which I didn’t realise. And then the guy recognised my accent and said ‘Oh, you’re fucking French’ and went on [about it], being really aggressive. It was really shocking.”\n\nHe feels that much of the time when people talk about immigrants “taking jobs” there is more to it than that.\n\n“What I hear behind that is more like racism,” he says. “And I think political people are fuelling this to attract some of the people [to vote to leave the EU].” JT",

Despite also being flush with cash, they’ve signed journeyman quarterback Thad Lewis and are known to have hosted two other who’s-he players, Ted Larsen and Lance Dunbar, on free-agent visits.\n\nFor starters, it should be noted that few teams outside of last year’s Broncos spend their way to Super Bowls. It’s widely considered prudent to build through the draft and judiciously supplement with free agents (see Packers, Patriots, Ravens).\n\nStill, the early stages of free agency have solidified a belief that began taking hold last year: The Raiders — yes, the Raiders of the Lost Stadium — are headed in a better direction than the 49ers.\n\nIn 2015, the Raiders took significant steps under first-year head coach Jack Del Rio and the rising-star trio of quarterback Derek Carr, rookie wide receiver Amari Cooper and linebacker Khalil Mack. Meanwhile, the 49ers kept regressing under since-fired rookie head coach Jim Tomsula and disgruntled and demoted quarterback Colin Kaepernick.\n\nNow, it has come to this: Smith, who was being courted by the 49ers, chose to sign with the Raiders, and no observers argued with his logic.\n\n“I just felt like with a few more pieces,” Smith said, “this team is ready to contend for real.”\n\nSo is there truth to the popular story line that the Raiders have become a destination and the 49ers are now a disaster?\n\nThat the Raiders are a destination is funny in itself, as they don’t know where they are going to be playing after next season. Whether they wind up in Los Angeles or San Diego (if the Chargers leave) or by some miracle, something gets done in Oakland, one thing is clear:\n\nOwner Mark Davis wants to win now.\n\nAnd after back-to-back home run drafts by general manager Reggie McKenzie and the hiring of Del Rio, whose leadership galvanized players last season, the Raiders are in a position to do so.\n\nAll they needed to do was take their $60 million-plus in salary-cap space and address some critical needs in free agency. Maybe a bully offensive lineman, a pass rusher to complement Mack and their first true No. 1 cornerback since Nnamdi Asomugha left.\n\nCheck, check, check. (In more ways than one.)\n\nAnd unlike previous years in which McKenzie’s hands were tied because of a lack of money or a lack of a desirable team, all the players are under 29 years old. No more overpaying players who didn’t have better options in order to show Oakland’s younger players how to win. School is over. Go win, baby.\n\nOsemele had back surgery in 2013 but played well last year, and the team thinks he can be an impact player at guard or tackle. Irvin didn’t become the next Aldon Smith as the Seahawks had planned, but he has shown he can get to the quarterback, and is a favorite of defensive coordinator Ken Norton Jr.\n\nSmith is exactly the big, physical cornerback (6-foot-2, 215 pounds) that the defense of Norton and Del Rio needs.\n\nAnd the Raiders aren’t done yet. They have $28 million in salary-cap space and need a safety, inside linebacker, another offensive lineman and running back. With another signing or two in the next week, they can take the best player available at No. 14 in next month’s draft.\n\nOakland is one of four teams in on former San Diego Pro Bowl safety Eric Weddle, who plans to look at initial contract offers and take the weekend to consider where he visits first. It’s also in on former Jets and Vikings linebacker Erin Henderson, and there is a still a small chance it can re-sign left tackle Donald Penn.\n\nThere is a real sense that the playoffs are the next step after last season’s 7-9 record.\n\nThe 49ers, of course, finished 5-11, but pointed to legitimate reasons for optimism in January.\n\nCEO Jed York noted the team’s salary-cap space ($53.7 million) and slew of draft picks as he expressed confidence in general manager Trent Baalke’s ability to rebuild.\n\nTwo weeks later, it was clear the 49ers had made their assets a selling point with Kelly, who sounded ready to start reshaping the roster.\n\n“You look at where they are in relationship to the salary cap,” Kelly said. “You look at where they are in terms of having 21 draft picks over the next two years. ... They’re prepared for the future, and it’s an exciting time to be part of that.”\n\nHowever, few teams have been duller in the early stages of free agency. The 49ers have committed at least $5 million annually to bring back their top in-house free agent, nose tackle Ian Williams, on a five-year deal. In addition, they re-signed placekicker Phil Dawson on a one-year deal reportedly worth $3.1 million.\n\nBut their overall lack of activity has created a confused chorus: What the heck are they doing?\n\nIt’s possible they are simply refusing to budge from their measured approach to free agency, regardless of their healthy bank account and thin roster.\n\nBaalke no doubt rolled his eyes in recent days as other teams doled out mega money for marginal players. The Falcons, for example, signed wideout Mohamed Sanu to a five-year, $32.5 million deal after his 33-catch performance in 2015.\n\n“You can’t just spend money to spend money,” York said in January. “You want to make sure that you’re spending money wisely.”\n\nThe 49ers could be surveying the free-agent landscape and concluding that the best way to start rebuilding is by focusing on their 12 draft picks. It’s a significant bounty that could include another second- or third-round pick if, as expected, they trade Kaepernick.\n\nA more sobering possibility for fans? The 49ers are ready to spend, but players are unwilling to accept their cash, given the state of a franchise increasingly marked by anonymous-source-fueled dysfunction. Last year, puzzled wide receiver Torrey Smith, who signed with the 49ers in 2015, said he hadn’t experienced leaks to the media during his first four seasons with the Ravens.\n\nAnd there is the matter of Kelly, who repeatedly waas ripped by ex-players during his three seasons in Philadelphia. It’s possible some of that was sour grapes, but public carping from prominent ex-Eagles such as DeSean Jackson and LeSean McCoy could make others wary of playing for Kelly.\n\nIn addition, free agents with options also might be leery of playing for a coach known for his devotion to sports science (daily urine tests) and frenetic-paced offense (running, running and running).\n\nFor his part, Baalke might find this situation familiar. In 2011, after the 49ers were coming off a 6-10 season, fans were up in arms as the team sat out the first days of free agency. After the market settled, however, Baalke made sales-rack signings that included Donte Whitner, Jonathan Goodwin and Carlos Rogers, three players who figured prominently in the franchise’s turnaround.\n\nFive years later, however, the only NFL turnaround that looks imminent in the Bay Area involves the Raiders.\n\nTheir owner obviously wants to win now and, after his string of free-agent signings, it appears he could get what he paid for.\n\nEric Branch and Vic Tafur are San Francisco Chronicle staff writers.

        "output": "Oakland has opened its overstuffed wallet to secure a road-grading offensive lineman (Kelechi Osemele), an elite edge rusher (Bruce Irvin) and a top cornerback (Sean Smith) for $43.9 million in guaranteed money.  In 2015, the Raiders took significant steps under first-year head coach Jack Del Rio and the rising-star trio of quarterback Derek Carr, rookie wide receiver Amari Cooper and linebacker Khalil Mack.  [...] the 49ers kept regressing under since-fired rookie head coach Jim Tomsula and disgruntled and demoted quarterback Colin Kaepernick.  Smith, who was being courted by the 49ers, chose to sign with the Raiders, and no observers argued with his logic.  [...] is there truth to the popular story line that the Raiders have become a destination and the 49ers are now a disaster?  [...] after back-to-back home run drafts by general manager Reggie McKenzie and the hiring of Del Rio, whose leadership galvanized players last season, the Raiders are in a position to do so.  Maybe a bully offensive lineman, a pass rusher to complement Mack and their first true No. 1 cornerback since Nnamdi Asomugha left.  Osemele had back surgery in 2013 but played well last year, and the team thinks he can be an impact player at  guard or tackle.  Irvin didn’t become the next Aldon Smith as the Seahawks had planned, but he has shown he can get to the quarterback, and is a favorite of defensive coordinator Ken Norton Jr.  Oakland is one of four teams in on former San Diego Pro Bowl safety Eric Weddle, who plans to look at initial contract offers and take the weekend to consider where he visits first.  CEO Jed York noted the team’s salary-cap space ($53.7 million) and slew of draft picks as he expressed confidence in general manager Trent Baalke’s ability to rebuild.  The 49ers have committed at least $5 million annually to bring back their top in-house free agent, nose tackle Ian Williams, on a five-year deal.  Baalke no doubt rolled his eyes in recent days as other teams doled out mega money for marginal players.  The 49ers could be surveying the free-agent landscape and concluding that the best way to start rebuilding is by focusing on their 12 draft picks.  Last year, puzzled wide receiver Torrey Smith, who signed with the 49ers in 2015, said he hadn’t experienced leaks to the media during his first four seasons with the Ravens.  [...] free agents with options also might be leery of playing for a coach known for his devotion to sports science (daily urine tests) and frenetic-paced offense (running, running and running).  Five years later, however, the only NFL turnaround that looks imminent in the Bay Area involves the Raiders."

        "instruction": "In his seventies and eighties, Dr. Albert Schweitzer had the kind of fame that at the time seemed irreversible. More than any other living man, he was accepted as the conscience of the ivilized world.\n\nEvery possible honor had been paid to him. Mere than half a million copies of his autobiography were in print. A poll taken among European scholars had put him with Coethe and Leonardo da Vinci as one of the three most remarkable of men. He got letters by the sackful every day. People all over the world felt that an entirely good man was among them, and they looked to him for comfort and reassurance. He was known to those people primarily as someone who, at the age of 30, “gave up everything” to go and found a hospital in a particularly cheerless part of Alma. Exactly what he did there and why he did it were much disputed by a skeptical minority. But for just about everyone else Dr. Schweitzer was a model of unselfishness and devotion to duty and wisdom that was plainspoken without being jejune. They wouldn't hear a word against him.\n\nDr. Schweitzer was never known to be ill, but on Sept. 4, 1965, in his 91st year, he died. Thereafter it was for history to say what he had done or not done, meant or not meant, betrayed or been true to. The curious thing is that today, on the 100th anniversary of his birth, with memorials him in various parts of the world, there are few people under 35, and not so many over it, who remember the time when the record was open and what all the fuss was about.\n\nThere are indications that Schweitzer pressed too closely upon the exposed nerve of one generation, only to be largely forgotten by the next. In public libraries his books are unnoticed on the shelf.\n\nWhat Remained of It All?\n\nHe wrote an 844‐page biography of Johann Sebastian Bach, he was world‐famous as an organist and an authority on organs, he held huge audiences enthralled with his sermons, he was philosopher and a theologian, and a man whb thought big and thought deeply about international affairs. Yet what remains of it all?\n\nIn the mid‐nineteen‐fifties, when Schweitzer was at the very height of his fame, I saw quite a bit of him. I was by no means alone in this, but we were thrown together in Giinsbach, the village in Alsace where he had been reared as a poor pastor's son; in Strasbourg, where an anonymous town house served as the administrative headquarters of his hospital; at the hospital itself, in what was then French Equatorial Africa (now Gabon), where we made a joint pilgrimage to the point on the Ogooti River at which Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza, the White Knight of French colonial exploration, had once pitched his camp, and finally in London, in October, 1955, when he appeared to receive that most lofty of British awards, the Order of Merit.\n\nMy last sight of him was when he boarded the cross‐Channel boat that was to take him back to France. Holding an archaic piece of handluggage, he headed firmly for the least expensive part of the boat, pausing only to sign his autograph for the policeman on duty.\n\nAt that time, though he was an old man in terms of years, he never showed it if he felt that time was running out for him. He had great difficulty with the acceptance speech he had to deliver in Oslo after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1952, but when in Giinsbach he padded along the village street as if he had nothing more urgent on his mind than the state of the vine‐wreathed hillsides around him. (He liked to say that the year of his birth was a great vintage year for Alsatian wine).\n\nLong Day at the Organ\n\nOnce seated in the organ loft of the village church, he would settle in as if for the rest of the day. In rapid passage work his enormous thumb seemed in no hurry to slide under his fingers, but it always got there on time. Nor was there a sign of haste as his ancient feet moved from pedal to pedal in their hardly less ancient shoes. It was as if he knew that the music would wait for him and that, as Bach once said, “If you press the right notes at the right time the organ will play itself.”\n\nThe music might wait, but other things wouldn't. One of them was the risk that further nuclear tests would contaminate the world irreparably and constitute, as the Frenc biologist Jean Rostand ha said, “a crime against th future.” Schweitzer worke for much of his life in Africz and it was of his own choir that he died there, but h was profoundly, irrevocabl!,\n\nwholeheartedly Europear Europe had not alway treated him well: He wa ‘locked up by the French World War I as an enern alien, and in 1918 hi mother was trampled ti death in Alsace by a regi ment of German cavalry. HE forgot neither of these. Wher Hitler was on the edge o coming to power in Germany in 1932, Schweitzer fell bound to speak his mind saying in public that “a deer darkness” was coming over his native country.\n\nThose events were part of the training through whirl he went, as it were, all hi! life so he could deal wit'r such problems as the nuclear tests. ‐ Gifted himself wits prodigious willpower, Int dreaded the misapplication of such power by others.\n\nAn ardent Wagneriar from his 17th year onward he yet did not identify wit the young Siegfried, that paragon of strength and endurance whose colossal energies were akin to his own. The character he remem bered best from Wagner's “Ring” was Loge, the liar and cheat who stood, as he said later, for. “the forces of destruction among the gods who were marching, all un. suspectingly, towards their fatal sunset.”\n\nIn the world of the fifties it was Loge, as Schweitzer saw it, who Was most likely to come out on top.\n\nThat period was Schweitzer's moment of maximum influence. Every word he cared to utter was printed and reprinted, translated against the clock, interpreted and reinterpreted. It was also the moment at which controversy about him and his activity was hottest.\n\nMuch of the criticism is /summarized by Gerald McKnight in his book “Verdict on Schweitzer,” published by John Day in 1964. It includes the charge that he stood in the way of hygiene and progress by perpetuating an antiquated hospital while he was alive, a charge that was repeated in 1965 by G. Mennen Williams, then under Secretary of State for African Affairs, and his wife, Nancy, after a visit. Mrs. Williams termed the clinic unkempt and unhealthful and described it as “deplorable.”\n\nMr. McKnight also asked: “Now that the hospital is rich, and its creator famous, what prevents Schweitzer from improving and modernizing conditions?” Schweitzer is also quoted as saying of his view that black Africans were too immature to be treated as other humans: “You cannot change their mentality.”\n\nSchweitzer knew that he had his critics the way an old ion knows that it has fleas. f it sometimes puzzled him hat they were quite so yinfictive, it was because he aw his years in Africa in toal perspective. When'he and nis wife first went there in 1905 they did not have it in nind that 50 years later reople from all over the vorld would come and say, ‘Tell us how to live.” The ichweitzers went to right pecific wrongs as best they ould.",

It also, it turns out, showed what people love about Twitter.\n\nOn Friday, at a rally in Portland, Oregon, Sanders was in the middle of a stump speech when a small bird touched down on the stage, then on his podium. The bird was seemingly unperturbed by the typically raucous Sanders crowd, and perched nonchalantly for a few moments before flittering off.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nThe candidate’s rumpled befuddlement, followed by wide-eyed amazement and broad smile, were exactly the sort of authenticity Sanders partisans seem to covet. And the bird, though its species is still unclear, was obviously a humble sort—among the 99% of birds, if you will.\n\nAs Sanders himself put it, “I think there may be some symbolism here.”\n\nSupporters immediately took to Twitter to spell that symbolism out, creating the hashtag #birdiesanders and a still-growing collection of graphics and memes. Most amplified the good-natured warmth of the moment:\n\nTech Companies Pushing for Political Influence On All Fronts\n\nSome tweets, though, took the opportunity to draw contrasts with Sanders’ competition, most notably Republican front runner Donald Trump and Democratic competitor Hillary Clinton.\n\nOthers went a little more absurdist:\n\n#BirdieSanders was as much a win for Twitter twtr as for Sanders. It’s the kind of moment CEO Jack Dorsey was talking about when he put ‘liveness’ at the center of the company’s ongoing push for user growth. It was Twitter users, far more than the media, who transformed a brief encounter into something bigger.\n\nThe bird does seem to have been a good omen for the candidate. On Saturday, Sanders went on to earn nearly 73% of the Democratic primary vote in Washington, and similarly dominant victories in Alaska and Hawaii.

When the market expects the Fed to do something that eventually the Fed must do, the Fed should do it as soon as possible.\n\nRead MoreMuch of Wall Street still believes in a September rate hike\n\nThe most likely objection to a September increase is that the Fed is worried about deflation and therefore has set a 2-percent inflation goal, which is unlikely to be achieved in the near future. But that is the wrong goal. First of all, given all the technological changes, improvements and innovations occurring in products we purchase today, how can anyone even measure inflation accurately? Secondly, low inflation has been helpful to our economy because although wages have been low, inflation has been even lower, increasing the purchasing power for the average American worker.\n\nThe Fed is right to worry about the dangers of deflation. Deflation occurs when consumers have money to spend but don't spend it because they expect prices to decline in the future, which increases the savings rate. If this becomes widespread, economic output falls and a deep and a prolonged recession or even a depression could occur. But the metric that the Fed should be watching to detect the possibility of deflation is not the inflation rate but rather the savings rate. If the savings rate increases beyond normal levels, that would be a danger sign. Thus far, the savings rate has been well within historical norms. Also, consumer purchasing power has been the strongest component of economic growth over the past few years.

        "instruction": "December 1989. My father gathered up his things in his New Jersey office and headed to the door, eager to get home to celebrate the holidays with our family. A co-worker stopped him to chat. \"Walter, what do you want for Christmas?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all. I have everything I've ever wanted. I've got my three girls.\" In other words, my mother, my 9-year-old sister and 3-year-old me.\n\nMy father got his private pilot's license in 1970 right after the army. \"He absolutely adored flying,\" my mom tells me. \"He didn't want to do anything else in his free time, besides hanging out with you guys.\" He bought a small, used, two-engine Piper airplane in 1988 for commuting back and forth to his two offices in New Jersey and North Carolina. He was a careful pilot and took attentive-almost obsessive-care of his plane.\n\nBut just a few weeks before that Christmas, he had an annual inspection, and the mechanic said he was missing a small part for detecting fire in the engine, but he would probably be fine until that part arrived.\n\nMy dad climbed in, taxied out to the runway, pushed the throttle forward and lifted into the sky.\n\nLife was good for my family in 1989. My father was the well-paid president of a marketing company, and made extra income from his side consulting business. My mother stayed at home raising my sister and me. She hadn't worked since 1980, when my sister was born.\n\nMom and Dad had just moved us to a tiny town in North Carolina to be closer to family. They bought some land, started building their dream home and convinced my grandparents to build a little home nearby. After looking at the dismal public schools, my parents enrolled my sister in private school and planned to do the same for me.\n\nIn short, they had a lot of financial obligations that depended on my father's income. But they were solid financially, with\n\nof about two year's take-home pay.\n\npaperwork on our new home and paid the bills. Around the time I was born, she took a look at my dad's life insurance coverage through his job. Many basic policies from employers will pay only about $30,000–not enough to support a family our size for very long.\n\nSo she set about calculating how much we would need if something were to happen, taking into account things like our mortgage and living expenses. She took out an additional\n\nto cover him, and a\n\nfor herself that was also meant to finance my sister's and my college educations. (Here's the difference between\n\nShe didn't know at the time, but it would turn out to be the smartest financial decision she would ever make.\n\nMy grandmother clearly remembers that day. On a step ladder at my grandparents' house, my mother called to my grandfather, \"Dad? Come quick. I feel like I'm going to faint.\" My grandfather got her off the ladder, and she laid down for a few minutes.\n\nMy grandmother sees this as proof of my mother and father's tight bond, because at almost that exact time in New Jersey, my father radioed the airport, saying his right engine was on fire. A few minutes later, he radioed again, saying the engine had broken off and he was in a downward spiral. Those were his last words. The official report listed the damage to the plane as \"destroyed.\"\n\nMy grandmother got the call from a friend of my father's, when she was in our kitchen with me and my sister. She kept her cool (remarkable, since she considered my dad one of her best friends in the world), calling a relative to come and get me and my sister. Then she drove home to tell my mother.\n\nI was barely 3 at the time, so I don't remember much about this time. The only utterly sad thing I do remember is a vision of my mother sometime during the weeks after, draped over the steering wheel of her pick-up truck, weeping.\n\nThe thing is, life went on, and I have many happy memories. I remember my mother asking me a few months later what color I wanted my new bedroom to be. (\"Pink!\") I remember Mrs. Stamp's private pre-school, where I learned about cocoons and how to spell \"cat.\" I remember walking, my hand in my sister's, on the way to our grandparents' house for a delicious Southern dinner of chicken and dumplings. I also remember my mother tapping numbers into her desk calculator, and the \"chit chit chit\" of it printing the results on ticker tape. She never looked at the numbers on the tape with panic or worry.\n\nNone of this would have been possible without life insurance.\n\nMy mother was faced with a long list of sudden expenses: the funeral, lawyer fees for executing my dad's estate, a mortgage, living expenses, private school and/or child care, and attempting to save for two college tuitions. If not for life insurance, she'd be doing all that with no income whatsoever, no job experience and savings that would only have lasted a few years.\n\nIt wouldn't have been easy for her to get a job after nine years out of the workforce, especially in our tiny town. \"I had no career to fall back on,\" she says. \"I would have had to go back to school.\" She would have disappeared into the workforce and night school, and my sister would have been yanked from her school right after we lost our father.\n\nWe also wouldn't have been able to finish the house, which would have meant an unsellable home with a giant mortgage. It would later take us three years to find a buyer for the finished home.\n\nLife insurance answered all those questions. \"It's wrenching, but it's a relatively simple process,\" my mother says of making the life insurance claim. \"You call up the insurance company; you tell them what happened. You fill out a form and you send in a death certificate.\" Then they send you a check. (Today, most life insurance companies actually refuse to insure people with non-commercial pilot licenses, presumably because of a rash of accidents.)\n\nIn our case, the life insurance paid off the mortgage, and provided enough for my mother to continue to stay at home with us until I was in high school. It funded private school for my sister and me through 8th grade. Although we had only paid nine years of premiums, we received a giant influx of money that would sustain us until my mom reinvented herself as an interior designer when I was in high school and reentered the workforce on her own terms.\n\nOf course, life wasn't the way it was before. The dinner parties went away, overseas vacations changed to a week at the beach once a year and dining out a trip to Bud's BBQ. But I was happy. I never noticed anything was \"wrong\" until I realized in third grade that, hey, everyone else has a dad and I didn't. But now, as a grown adult, I realize how incredibly lucky I've been to have the life and opportunities I did. Things could have been so much worse.\n\nMy mother has this advice for parents: \"You have, have, have to get life insurance. Figure out what you can cut so you can afford it. It's much more important to have life insurance than that extra dinner out.\" Depending on your age and your health-see more about how to get quotes on policies below-a 20-year term life insurance policy with $1 million in coverage can cost as little as $50 a month.\n\nto learn about the basics. Then,\n\nto take out a policy yourself.\n\nHopefully, you'll never need it. But as my family learned, bad things do happen. Life insurance couldn't replace my dad, but it did replace the income we depended on, and kept my childhood relatively intact.",

It appeared to have stepped up enforcement over the weekend, with people on social media and online forums reporting mass outages.\n\nA Twitter user with the handle @mrmitchclarke told the streaming service on Wednesday he would stop paying, attaching a screenshot of a Netflix page telling the user payment cannot proceed.\n\nA Twitter user with the handle @Sethalos said the Netflix service available to Canadian users is “terrible.”\n\n“So what other choice do you have other than Torrent,” he said, referencing BitTorrent, the free peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol that allows illegal movie and TV show downloads.\n\nNetflix’s move comes after its forecast of slower subscription growth this quarter, which sent its shares tumbling 8 percent in after-hours trading on Monday.\n\nA Netflix spokeswoman referred to the company’s January announcement and Monday’s video conference about the company’s earnings and declined further comment.\n\nIn the earnings call, Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings dismissed concerns that the crackdown might affect business.\n\n“It’s a very small, but quite vocal minority,” Hastings said of the users affected by the crackdown. “It’s really inconsequential to us.”\n\nFor more about Netflix, watch:\n\nNetflix grants unlimited access to its selection of TV shows and movies for a monthly fee and is known for its original shows including Orange is the New Black and House of Cards.",

Chan School of Public Health that included results from 12 published studies and health information from more than 786,000 participants. While the whole grain movement has been afoot for years, this is the first analysis of this type linking whole grains to mortality risk, said Qi Sun, assistant professor in the school's department of nutrition and senior author of the study.\n\nPeople who ate 70 grams of whole grains per day, compared with those who ate little or no whole grains, had lower risk of premature death, according to the Harvard analysis. Whole grains also lowered the risk for cancer and cardiovascular disease, the study found.\n\nBut Sun also cautioned that a healthy life requires more than just whole grains.\n\n\"Whole grains should be considered part of a healthy diet and lifestyle,\" Sun said Monday. \"They should not be considered a magic food, or a magic bullet, for increasing longevity.\"\n\nParticularly in processed foods, refined grains — milled grains stripped of their bran and germ — have been used to extend shelf life. Food companies often fortify those grains by adding lost nutrients back in, hence the term \"enriched grains.\"\n\nBut unrefined whole grains are better sources of fiber and other important nutrients, such as magnesium, potassium and selenium, according to the Mayo Clinic website.\n\nIn recent years, major food companies have scrambled to meet increased demand for food considered to be healthier, often through acquisitions, but sometimes through changing existing products or launching new ones.\n\nKraft Heinz, which is co-headquartered in Chicago, revamped its line of Smart Ones pasta meals to include pasta made with whole wheat flour in 2014. The company also sells a version of its Kraft macaroni and cheese that's \"made with 50 percent whole grain.\"\n\nIn 2012, Deerfield-based Mondelez International, perhaps best known for products like Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers, launched its belVita Breakfast Biscuits in the U.S.; each four-biscuit package contains 18 to 20 grams of whole grains. By 2020, Mondelez plans to increase the use of whole grains in products by 25 percent.\n\nSimilarly, Chicago-based Quaker Oats launched its Breakfast Flats earlier this year, with one serving, or three bars, containing 18 grams of whole grains. And ConAgra Foods, which is moving its headquarters to Chicago from Omaha, Neb., this month, has recently unveiled whole-grain products like Healthy Choice Simply Cafe Steamers and P.F. Chang's Steamed Brown Rice.\n\n\"It's a good thing if food companies are making more products with whole grains. ... I think they're probably responding to increased demand,\" Sun said.\n\nThe Harvard study supports current U.S. dietary guidelines that recommend at least 3 daily servings — or 48 grams — of whole grains to \"improve long-term health and prevent premature death,\" Sun said.\n\nWhile not technically a whole grain, quinoa (it's more like a grass seed) is nutritionally comparable to a whole grain, Sun said. Oatmeal and brown rice also are good alternatives to refined carbohydrates, he said.",

Simpson struggled to put on a pair of shrunken bloody gloves found at the crime scene where the NFL star's ex-wife and her friend were brutally murdered.\n\nprosecutors believe linked Simpson to the murders of his ex-wife,\n\n, many believe the bloody glove episode clinched the case for the defense – especially when Simpson's lead attorney, Johnny Cochran, famously said, \"If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.\"\n\nBut prosecutor Christopher Darden, who tried Simpson along with lead prosecutor\n\n, tells PEOPLE the case was \"lost way before this.\"\n\n\"I don't think they did not fit,\" Darden, now 60, says. \"But it was a great visual for the defense and it was a great piece of acting by O.J.\"\n\nWhile Darden says he doesnât know how the moment impacted jurors, he publicly took the brunt of the blame for the decision to have Simpson try them on. But now, he says, \"There's more to the story\" behind the decision to have Simpson try on the gloves.\n\nThough he would not reveal additional details, he tells PEOPLE, \"Two people [other than him] know – and one knows better than the other.\"\n\n\"What happened with the glove thing – why it was done, when it was done, whose decision it was to do it, and what the thinking was behind it – what everybody has seen and heard is the generic point of view,\" he says.\n\n\"I took responsibility for it. Nobody else has to. My decision. That is the official record that I've created. And that's fine.\"\n\nHe adds, \"I suppose I'll be taking that story to my grave along with a lot of other things. There's no point in saying any more about it.\"\n\nDespite the verdict, Darden says, \"To this day, I am a true believer that he is guilty.\" He adds, \"I saw the evidence for myself.\"\n\nDarden chronicled his experiences from the sensational trial in his bestselling 1996 book,\n\nBut after being portrayed in the hit FX series\n\n, which focused largely on the lives of the attorneys involved, Darden is concerned about how he will be remembered – especially since he questions the series' accuracy.\n\n\"If I died tomorrow, the last thing people will ever hear about me is what was in the miniseries,\" he says. \"That matters to me. It's important to me because it's going to be important to my children and grandchildren.\"\n\nOne of the most poignant moments of the case came when Darden broke down after the verdict during a press conference, leaving the podium to hug Fred Goldman, the father of Ronald Goldman.\n\n\"I was very emotional and it was really hard for me to look at them,\" he says. \"I had always stood up for victims and I had always done well. I recognized how painful it is to lose a loved one to homicide.\n\n\"But you know, part of it was knowing how heartbroken they were and how much they had endured and that I contributed to the failure of the case.\"\n\nWhen he reluctantly headed to the podium after the verdict, he says he got upset because \"I had been holding a lot inside for a long time, controlling my temper and keeping my composure and holding my tongue even though so much of what happened in that case was so outrageous and so over the top. It was so offensive to me. We turned that whole thing into a soap opera. How could we do this?\n\n\"Two people are dead, two families are devastated and the whole thing is corrupt. It was a dirty, dirty trial.\n\n\"You have to wonder how anybody could get justice in a situation like that.\"\n\nWhile people still ask Darden about Simpson, he says, \"I donât think about him as much as I think about Ron and Nicole.

        "instruction": "NASIRIYA, Iraq, Nov. 12 — A car or truck bomb exploded in the courtyard of an Italian paramilitary police headquarters in this southern Iraqi city on Wednesday, killing 17 Italians and at least 9 Iraqis and wounding more than 105 others. It was the most lethal single attack on forces of the American-led occupation since Saddam Hussein was swept from power in April.\n\nThe bomb exploded at 10:40 a.m. local time, ripping apart the three-story building and an annex that stand beside a broad stretch of the Euphrates river in the center of Nasiriya, 180 miles south of Baghdad. The lightly protected buildings, formerly the city's Chamber of Commerce, served as offices and accommodation for 200 members of the Carabinieri, the Italian military police force, and most were in the buildings at the time of the attack.\n\n\"A truck crashed into the entrance of the military police unit, closely followed by a car which detonated,\" a spokeswoman for the British-led multinational force in southern Iraq said shortly after the blast.\n\nAn Iraqi witness said he saw a blue-and-white Russian-built truck approach the building at high speed along a boulevard leading to the river, with a bearded man in the front passenger seat firing at Italian guards before the vehicle swung past the guards and a line of low, earth-filled barriers before exploding.\n\nThere were no claims of responsibility for the attack, the latest in a series that have struck at not only Americans but other foreigners and the Iraqis that support them. Earlier targets have included the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Jordanian Embassy.\n\nHours after the blast, American forces launched a pair of ferocious strikes against suspected loyalists of Saddam Hussein's government in Baghdad, signaling a new and more aggressive strategy. [Article, Page A10.]\n\nIn Nasiriya, the force of the bombing of the Italian compound left a crater 50 yards from the main building that was more than 50 feet across and 10 feet deep. The front and side of the building was sheered off, with iron beds, desks and other equipment and personal belongings strewn in the wreckage.\n\nAmmunition stored in the building exploded, and vehicles in an adjacent parking lot caught fire, sending a huge plume of flame and smoke curling for hours into the clear autumn air. A wide area around the site was immediately sealed off by Italian and Romanian troops.\n\nMany of the Italians killed and wounded in the attack had been due to head back to Italy at midweek, at the end of a four-month stint.\n\nIn addition to the dead, there were 20 Italians among the wounded. At the Nasiriya hospital, doctors said 85 Iraqis had been injured, 30 seriously. They said the dead included three schoolgirls of about 10 who died in a passing minibus, as well as a 10-day-old infant whose mother survived. At least 10 of the injured Iraqis were women and children.\n\nIn Rome, Italy's defense minister, Antonio Martino, blamed loyalists of Mr. Hussein for the attack but presented no evidence to support his claim. The Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, said Italy would not be shaken from its commitment to Iraq and the United States.\n\nAn Italian official representing the Coalition Provisional Authority, the American-led governing body, told reporters 12 hours after the blast that its force left little that was immediately identifiable from any vehicle or attacker. Whether the attack was carried out by a car and a truck, or only one vehicle, was in doubt, the official, Andrea Angeli, said.\n\nHe said the Italians killed were 11 military police officers, 4 soldiers and 2 civilians, one a television documentary filmmaker.\n\nAttacks have killed more than 40 American soldiers since the beginning of November, and a total of 154 Americans since President Bush declared major combat operations over on May 1, contributing to a sense of crisis in Washington as administration officials seek ways to stabilize the situation.\n\nThe immediate question raised by Wednesday's bombing was how it would affect the United States' faltering efforts to draw other nations into committing troops and police to the occupation forces.\n\nAmerican officials say 33 nations are represented in the occupation effort, but an American diplomatic drive to draw contingents from Muslim nations like Turkey and Pakistan has failed, and several nations in Europe, including France and Germany, have also refused. Italy's role has been prized by Washington in the face of broad European resistance.\n\nAmong international agencies seeking to bring relief to Iraq's 22 million people, morale has been battered by the bombings of the United Nations headquarters in August, which killed 22 people, and the blast that struck the Baghdad compound of the International Red Cross late last month, killing at least 12. Both organizations have ordered all non-Iraqi personnel to leave Baghdad.\n\nThe attack on Wednesday was followed by reassurances for Washington from nations that have said that they will send troops here. In Portugal, which had pledged to replace some of the Italian paramilitary troops who were the target of the bombing, officials said plans to send 128 police officers to Iraq were unaltered. But opposition parties demanded that Prime Minister Jose Manuel Durao Barroso's conservative government review the plan, which has drawn limited support in Portuguese opinion polls.",

For me, the only thing that matters is the tangible.' At 93, the artist Louise Bourgeois might be forgiven a degree of disillusion. In fact, she seems to be moving in the other direction - deeper into the illuminations offered by the last century. As she does so, we are reminded that as well as being a great artist, Bourgeois is also a great rationalist. She offers us routes out of our dilemmas.\n\nThis new show is conceived as a taster to an upcoming retrospective. It includes two new hanging aluminium sculptures, a sequence of drawings and a revelatory new narrative work. Sublimation (2002) could more crudely be titled 'Shit Happens But You Make Something of It'. Over 15 pages of text and drawings - coils, spirals, eyes - the artist explores feelings evoked by watching a couple rowing violently in the presence of their son. The response of their son is to grab a broom and start sweeping the floor.\n\nFor Bourgeois, the moment when the boy reaches to perform this displacing action is key. 'The child was 14 and he was pretty strong. And I am not 14 any more. I still sometimes feel that chaos surging up on me ... at that point you begin to operate a symbolic action.

Game publishers, which include Electronic Arts, Activision, and Disney, have been stringently opposed to the proposal.\n\nThe authorization does not mean the strike is guaranteed, but it does give the voice actors more leverage in their ongoing negotiations with publishers. An overwhelming 95.62% of eligible members voted in favor of the strike, according to the guild. (Voting on the authorization ended Oct. 6.)\n\nSAG-AFTRA voice actors have been without a contract since the beginning of the year, as both sides have worked on renegotiating what’s known as The Interactive Media Agreement. Bargaining sessions in February and June were unsuccessful, leading to the strike authorization vote.\n\nWhile performance bonuses/residuals are at the heart of the matter, the union also says it believes actors should get stunt pay for vocally stressful recording sessions and that stunt coordinators should be on hand during motion performance capture sessions.\n\nVideo game publishers contacted by Fortune declined to comment on the matter.\n\nMORE: The video game industry is growing old, lazy, and boring\n\nWhile video games have increasingly become more cinematic in both their visual style and in the quality of acting, analysts say they believe that while quality voice acting certainly adds to the impact of a game, a strike likely wouldn’t have a big impact on sales.\n\n“I can’t think of one game that consumers have ever bought because of the voice actors,” says P.J. McNealy, CEO and founder of Digital World Research. “They certainly play a critical role in setting the tone and some of the drama for a game—such as the Master Chief’s voice in Halo—but people buy games for the action and the experience. And I think that’s what matters most to consumers.”\n\nTo whip up public support among vocal core gamers, several voice actors, including actor and geek icon Wil Wheaton, took to social media in late September to raise awareness about the campaign with the “#PerformanceMatters” hashtag campaign.\n\nOrion Acaba, a voice actor with over 30 roles to his name, including “Apollo Justice” in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney and “Crazy Dave” in the original Plants vs. Zombies, explained the situation for fans in a series of Tweets.\n\n“New wage contracts haven’t happened since the days of N64,” he wrote. “That was before voiceover was more quintessential in production of games. The hurdles are more complicated than one might think. … A game like Call of Duty will make millions upon millions, and the publisher will keep mostly all of it. The developers of that game might and probably get extra here and there, and that’s about it. Actors are given nothing after release.

        "instruction": "After years of teases, it’s official: Donald Trump is running for president.\n\nThe businessman, reality TV star, and former Fortune cover boy announced Tuesday that he is running for the 2016 Republican nomination, just four years after he choose not to try to unseat president Obama in 2012, despite his vociferous criticisms of the president and self-professed belief that he would be the Republican most likely to win in a general election.\n\nIn his speech Tuesday morning, Trump pointed to failures of the U.S. in the international arena and said he would do better than Obama.\n\n“When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let’s say China, in a trade deal?” he said “They kill us. I beat China all the time.”\n\nTrump’s speech was, fittingly, not a standard presidential announcement. Rather than focusing on broad themes, Trump jumped from issue to issue and outlined specific problems he saw. He veered from trade deals to ISIS to illegal immigration with no transitions, and seemingly no central thesis beyond “Obama bad, Trump good!” Despite this, the assembled crowd screamed its appreciation for Trump multiple times.\n\n“I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created,” he declared at one point.\n\nFinally, after all of that, he announced exactly what the people had gathered for:\n\n“I am officially running for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again,” he said.\n\nOf great interest will be Trump’s personal finances: he’s expected to reveal documents today showing a personal wealth of around $9 billion, which will surely be scrutinized as the election campaign heats up.\n\nTrump started offering hints leading up to the announcement Tuesday. For instance, he changed his header image on his Twitter account to read “Trump: Make America Great Again.”\n\nIn recent years Trump has become a controversial political commentator, appearing frequently on news outlets, especially Fox, to offer scathing criticism of the president. He was an ardent supporter of the “birther” movement, which argues that Barack Obama is not an American citizen. While these tactics endear him to a certain element of the conservative base of the party, Trump will have to offer more than that if he wants any success. In a very crowded Republican primary field, he is more likely to cast himself as the most business-savvy and economically sound candidate.\n\nWhile this offers some positives for Trump — despite the myriad contenders, there are no other Republican candidates who can make private business enterprise their calling card the way Trump can, and the way Mitt Romney did in 2012 — it also gives competitors in both the primary and, if Trump somehow manages to emerge from the rubble, the general election, a lot of ammunition.\n\nAfter all, Trump and his companies have filed for bankruptcy several times. While Trump has claimed that this is a strategic use of American law, in a debate it would be easy for opponents to score points by pointing out that if Trump can’t manage his own private business, how is he to be expected to run the business of the American public?",

They all have their place. So does grüner veltliner, except that I lost sight of it.\n\nNonetheless, grüner veltliner has become a staple in shops and restaurants, particularly in the warm weather. It is distinctive and unusual, and so it seemed like a good wine for us to examine, even if it was partly because I wanted to reconsider my bias. As usual, I recommended three bottles and invited readers to drink them and share their thoughts by commenting at nytimes.com/food.\n\nHere are the three I selected: Knoll Wachau Loibner Kreutles Federspiel 2014, Hirsch Kamptal Kammern Heiligenstein 2014 and Nikolaihof Wachau Hefeabzug 2014.\n\nEric Asimov, The New York Times\n\nwine critic, is talking about\n\nIf you would like to join the\n\nconversation, try one of the bottles\n\nlisted here and as you try them, ask yourself these questions.\n\nGrüner veltliner often inspires an unusual lexicon. What does it taste like?\n\nHow does it go with food?\n\nThe grüner re-examination went very well. I actually loved these wines, or at least the possibilities they offered. And I loved that whatever I had been missing about grüner veltliner before now seemed obvious to me.\n\nThe operative term in drinking these wines was the color green, which is rarely used as a compliment when discussing wine. Often “green” is meant to suggest that the grapes were not ripe enough, imparting a vegetal flavor to what may preferably be sweetly fruity. Sometimes it’s used unfairly to denigrate the herbal flavors that are classically a part of cabernet sauvignon or cabernet franc. That’s an interpretation of green worth embracing.\n\nBut in grüner veltliner, “green” took on an entirely different meaning. Each of these grüners had a slight vegetal quality that was welcome and delightfully refreshing, like the snap of a crisp green bean at peak ripeness. Green, crunchy, peppery, with a squeeze of lemon and, in the best examples, a strong current of minerality.\n\nThe Nikolaihof was my favorite of these wines. “Hefeabzug” indicates that the wine was aged on its lees, the remnants of yeast that remain after fermentation, in the manner of Champagne or good Muscadet. The effect is to give this wine a richness that belies its slender level of 11 percent alcohol.\n\nOn the palate, the wine was bright and refreshing, with peppery, citrus flavors, that crunchy green-bean quality and a delicious thread of minerality. This wine was not only great with pan-fried chicken, but it also went beautifully with a summery pasta dish with fresh tomatoes and arugula.\n\nBy contrast, the Hirsch seemed a little simpler to me. Its dominant flavor was lemon, with a tinge of green beans and a floral note. It did not seem as incisive as the Nikolaihof, nor was there apparent minerality. I liked it well enough on its own, but a side-by-side comparison was not flattering.\n\nThe Knoll, from the Kreutles vineyard, was labeled “federspiel,” a designation indicating that the grapes had been picked at a medium level of ripeness, as opposed to the very ripe designation of smaragd. This system of labeling is used only in the Wachau region, and not always there, as the Nikolaihof, which most likely was the equivalent of a federspiel, did not use the term.\n\nI found the Knoll tart and deliciously green and crunchy, with a note of iodine that reminded me of nothing so much as single-malt whisky. (This is maybe the first time I’ve ever said that about a wine.) It was indeed idiosyncratic yet crisp and refreshing.\n\nI do think the green elements were partly a character of the 2014 vintage, as I’ve had grüners from warmer years that were much fruitier. But I really liked this leaner style, which went great with food. I would also point out that for each of these producers, the choices were among their entry-level wines. If they are intriguing to you, even more distinctive, complex expressions await exploration.\n\nMost readers seemed to enjoy the grüner veltliners, even if the bottles I recommended were not easy to find. Since the flavors that I described as green are unusual to find in wine, I was curious to see how readers might experience them.\n\nJim M. of Madison, Wis., who drank a 2012 Schloss Gobelsburg, found notes of buckwheat and sorghum, along with mineral flavors. Svetlana of Toronto, who described herself as an “avid grüner enthusiast,” said the wines often have the aromas of “white pepper, lentils and other vegetal notes,” though she added that riper versions can be exotically fruity.\n\nOn the other hand, terms like “lentil” and “sorghum” did not move Dan Barron of New York. Rather, he experienced the wine strictly in relation to how it enhanced a meal. The Nikolaihof with Indian food was “quiet, forgettable,” he said, but with grilled scallops it became “a quiet, enigmatic force field of a wine,” which I think he meant as a good thing.\n\nReaders seemed to feel that these grüners went well with food. VSB went so far as to call them “ridiculously versatile,” though Sean McCarthy of Wainscott, N.Y., who drank a Hirtzberger grüner veltliner, found it “flat and watery” with hamburgers. He wondered whether a more traditional pairing would have been better but said, “I doubt the conclusion will change.”\n\nSean, I hear you. But give it a year or two. Try some other grüner veltliners with the sort of food it was meant to accompany. (You can’t go wrong with schnitzel.) You may feel the same way afterward, but you may not. That’s one of the things so fascinating about wine.",

But becoming a \"SuperEntrepreneur\" takes more than a fearless attitude, mostly, it takes a degree.\n\n\"Entrepreneurship\", the report states, \"is often knowledge-intensive.\"\n\nOnly 16 percent of U.S. Super Entrepreneurs do not have a college degree. In fact, half of U.S. super entrepreneurs have an advanced degree – such as an MA, MBA or doctorate – and they are five times more likely to hold a PhD than the general population.\n\nA competitive spirit and a thirst for wealth are also high on the list. Successful entrepreneurs, the report states, \"tend to be competitive and economically oriented in their thinking.\"\n\nFor 73 percent of entrepreneurs surveyed, economic profits were motivating factors and wealth, a sign of success and recognition by peers and by society.\n\nAnd the old \"divide to conquer\" adage proves true. An entrepreneur is more likely to be successful by creating several companies than he would be if he'd relentlessly pursued a single business idea.\n\nIn terms of where the winning ideas come from, the report highlights that opportunities for the \"SuperEntrepreneurs\" are aplenty and in almost all industries – from health care, to renewable energy and rubbish collection.\n\nBut IT, biotech, finance and retail seem to be where most billions are made. Drawing on Forbes data, the authors points out that IT and biotech \"absorb far more than half of all U.S. venture capital investments.\"\n\nRead MoreWealthy resume hunt for properties in paradise\n\nHong Kong has the most of SuperEntrepreneurs in the survey , with around three per million inhabitants, followed by Israel - with close to two per million. The U.S. comes third, followed by Switzerland and Singapore.\n\nAs a rule, countries with the most billionaires identified by the survey seem to have more competitive tax regimes, a high rate of venture capital investments as part of the economy and less self-employed people.\n\nGreece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, for instance, have a 20-to-30 percent self-employment rate outside of agriculture, but their innovative entrepreneurship rate is low. In contrast, only about 10-to-15 percent of workers are self-employed in the U.S., Canada, Japan and Switzerland, but innovative entrepreneurship is high.\n\nOverall, western Europe is lagging behind Asia and the U.S.. Only 42 percent of the Old Continent's billionaires are self-made entrepreneurs, the rest having inherited their wealth. In the U.S. however, 70 percent are self-made billionaires while in China, \"virtually all\" are self-made.\n\nThe report highlights that according to the latest data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the average regulatory regime in Western Europe is twice as burdensome as in the U.S. And governments, including the European Union, who try to boost innovation, fail to realise the difference between self-employment and innovative entrepreneurship.\n\nThe report explains that policymakers assume that policies that promote innovative entrepreneurship and those that help out self-employed people and small and medium size enterprises are one and the same. However, it goes on, \"many policies have the opposite effect on self-employment and innovative entrepreneurship.\"\n\nIf you succeed, not only can you lie back and enjoy your billion but be comforted in the fact that, as a 2010 Gallup survey shows, 84 percent of the public will have a positive opinion of you. Sadly, the same cannot be said for other wealthy individuals.\n\nRead More Spare $55 million? Consider buying this Bahamas island\n\nFollow us on Twitter: @CNBCWorld",

Bush. He also was a health policy adviser to Republican Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential race.\n\nClick here to read the Center for Public Integrity's version of this story.\n\nValdez said in court papers that he served as president of MSO of Puerto Rico, also owned by a subsidiary of Aveta, for eight months until his dismissal in December 2010. MSO worked with local doctors to coordinate coverage for some 230,000 elderly and disabled people then enrolled in those two Aveta-related Medicare Advantage health plans. In a press release touting his hire, Aveta said Valdez would enhance medical care while \"effectively managing healthcare costs.\"\n\nAveta's Puerto Rico health plans and MSO are now operated by InnovaCare Health Solutions, according to the firm's website. InnovoCare has the same Fort Lee, New Jersey office and phone number as Aveta. Several members of the Aveta board, including founding principal investor Daniel E. Straus, have been affiliated with both companies. Innovacare general counsel Christopher J. Joyce declined to discuss the corporate structure.\n\nStraus, a prominent investor in several health-care businesses, also has worked with hedge funds and as a New York City real estate developer. Joyce said Straus would have no comment.\n\nClick here to read the Center's investigation of Medicare Advantage overbilling.\n\nThe whistleblower suit is significant not only for the magnitude of overbilling it alleges. It also raises questions about federal oversight of billing practices by health plans that contract with the government to cover nearly 16 million Americans, at a cost expected to top $150 billion this year.\n\nThe federal government paid the two Puerto Rico plans a total of between $1 billion and $1.8 billion annually from January 2007 through December 2010, according to the suit. Up to $350 million a year was for bills that were \"improperly inflated,\" according to Valdez.\n\nValdez argues that the health plans sought out chronically ill patients, who command the highest Medicare payment rates, but overcharged for them by manipulating a billing formula known as a \"risk score.\" Medicare sets risk scores for all patients based on medical data submitted by the health plans that indicates how sick patients are. Sicker patients mean higher rates.\n\nThese scores \"were false or fraudulent because they were based on diagnosis codes that were not substantiated by the medical records or by the medical conditions of the Medicare beneficiaries served by the plans,\" the suit states.\n\nValdez said he was told by top executive Shinto in May 2010 that an internal audit of medical records had confirmed that two-thirds of patient risk scores could not be supported.\n\nAccording to Valdez, the audit results were discussed at several executive-level meetings, including some at which top brass talked about setting up a reserve fund in case federal officials should conduct their own review and demand refunds.\n\nAt a July 2010 meeting, Penelope Kokkinides, Aveta's chief operating officer, allegedly said the company would be \"screwed\" if it was audited by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), especially if the review reached back to 2007. She said overcharges had been \"particularly egregious\" that year, as the suit paraphrased her alleged remarks.\n\nKokkinides estimated the liability to the government was as high as 20 percent of its total Medicare payment, or about $350 million a year, Valdez alleges. Kokkinides declined to comment on the suit.\n\nDuring his tenure there, Valdez said, company officials gave no indication they would \"notify CMS of the problem or return the improperly obtained funds to the government,\" according to the suit. CMS regulations not only require Medicare Advantage plans to attest that risk data they present for payment are accurate but also obligate them to return any overpayments they discover.\n\nStill, CMS largely trusts the nation's 700 Medicare Advantage plans to report risk scores accurately and honestly -- and conducts only a smattering of yearly audits. There's no indication that CMS officials reviewed the risk scores for the two Puerto Rican plans. In its 2012 annual financial report to insurance officials in Puerto Rico, MMM Healthcare stated that it had not been subject to a CMS payment audit.\n\nHowever, in late March of 2011, Valdez said he took his allegations to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, which has since launched an investigation. That investigation \"has not been completed,\" government lawyers wrote in a January 2014 court filing.\n\nValdez blamed the faulty risk scores on errors in \"medical status visit\" forms filled out by the plans' doctors. The visits were done to help identify \"high risk\" members and maximize payments for them. Doctors participated in a profit sharing arrangement that paid them 50 percent to 60 percent of surplus money that came in from Medicare as a result of the annual visits, according to the suit.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that company officials failed to take \"corrective measures to delete or filter out\" inaccurate codes, although they knew the doctors had an incentive to inflate them.\n\nIn July 2010, executives decided to hold onto millions of dollars in these payments to the doctors in case CMS auditors required the company to repay money, according to the suit.\n\nThat concern didn't dissuade company officials from borrowing $100 million, which was used to pay a dividend to investors, \"the largest of whom was founder and Chairman Daniel E. Straus,\" according to the suit. Valdez said he objected to paying the dividend while the potential liability to the government \"remained unaddressed.\"\n\n—By Fred Schulte, Center for Public Integrity, for NBC News",

The long-term stability of this program is largely defined by insurer reactions, so this is a good sign.\"\n\n\"It gets harder to repeal a program when it has a vibrant commercial market attached,\" Mendelson said.\n\nCeci Connolly, managing director of PriceWaterhouseCoopers Health Research Institute, said, \"It's clear insurers see growth opportunity in the new exchanges and are meeting the market demand for choice.\"\n\n\"Two other significant points – we're seeing average premium increases nationally of about 7 percent, a sure sign that competition is good for consumers,\" Connolly said. \"And second, with attention turning to the private exchanges that will open for employers in the coming years, HRI recently reported that 32 percent of employers are considering shifting their employees to exchange-based health coverage. All evidence that exchanges will be an enduring part of the developing new health economy.\"\n\nLarry Levitt, an Obamacare expert with the Kaiser Family Foundation, on his Twitter account responded to the news: \"With more insurers selling in ACA marketplaces, the law has passed the viability test. Logistical challenges remain.\"\n\nThose logistical challenges include an ongoing re-vamp of HealthCare.gov's enrollment technology, which has some experts worried that the federal Web site will not run smoothly when open enrollment resumes Nov. 15.\n\nAnd that site still has yet to build a so-called \"back end,\" whose technology is supposed to run calculations for financial programs that are designed to minimize the risk insurers face by covering people through exchange-sold plans.\n\nThis season's open-enrollment period will end Feb. 15, and be about three months shorter than Obamacare's first season.\n\nAbout 8.1 million people selected Obamacare plans by the end of open enrollment this past mid-April.

There’s a constant realization that there’s always another election coming, and those who want to keep their jobs – and avoid voters’ wrath – will have to be responsible stewards of the public trust.\n\nBut what if these norms start to break down? What if the incentives baked into the cake prove to be faulty?\n\n[This] is especially galling for Democrats, but it’s a win for Republicans and yet another sign of change in the way Washington is likely to work in the future. Republicans have discovered that a sufficiently united party can obstruct everything and anything but largely escape blame for the resulting gridlock.\n\nThis lesson has not been lost on Democrats, and it bodes ill for the future regardless of who wins our next few elections.\n\nI think that’s correct and it’s a point that’s not repeated nearly enough.\n\nIn a democratic model, the last couple of years have been a mess of historic proportions. Republicans, consciously or not, decided to roll the dice – they would ignore the 2012 election results, refuse to govern, and kill measures regardless of their merit, popular support, or bipartisan appeal. They would shut down the government. They would eschew compromise. They would ignore calls to present policy solutions of their own. They would create the least productive Congress in modern American history.\n\nAnd then they would wait for the American people to give them a reward.\n\nWhich voters delivered yesterday with a lovely bow on top.\n\nWhen there is no accountability in a political system, there is no incentive for even well-intentioned policymakers to behave responsibly.

The process isn’t supposed to work this way, and yet we now know it works exactly this way.\n\nThe resulting precedent is more than a little discouraging. When failure is rewarded, it encourages more failure. When obstruction is rewarded, it encourages more obstruction. When radicalism is rewarded, it encourages more radicalism. When a refusal to compromise is rewarded, it means politicians will be led to believe they, too, should refuse to work on bipartisan solutions.\n\nIt’s not a recipe for sound governance.",
